Climbing the walls while the hours fall
Straining against the noise of traffic music
Anything alive to catch your key in the door
And that scamper of feeling in my chest
As if the day the night wherever it is
I am by then has been only a whir
Of something other than waiting
We hear so much about what love feels like
Right now today with the rain outside
And leaves that want as much as I do to believe
In May in seasons that come when called
Its impossible not to want
To walk into the next room and let you
Run your hands down the sides of my legs
Knowing perfectly well what they know
The earth is dry and they live wanting
Each with a small reservoir
Of furious music heavy in the throat
They drag it out and with nails in their feet
Coax the night into being Brief believing
A skirt shimmering with sequins and lies
And in this night that is not night
Each word is a wish each phrase
A shape their bodies ache to fill
Im going to braid my hair 
Braid many colors into my hair            
Ill put a long braid in my hair       
And write your name there 
They defy gravity to feel tugged back
The clatter the mad slap of landing
And not just them Not just
The ramshackle family the tíosPrimitos not just the bailaor
Whose heels have notched
And hammered time
So the hours flow in place
Like a tin river marking
Only what once was
Not just the voices of scraping
Against the river nor the hands
Nudging them farther fingers
Like blind birds palms empty
Echoing Not just the women
With sober faces and flowers
In their hair the ones who dance
As though theyre burying
Memoryone last time
Beneath them
And I hate to do it here
To set myself heavily beside them
Not now that theyve proven
The body a myth a parable
For what not even language
Moves quickly enough to name
If I call it pain and try to touch it
With my hands my own life
It lies still and the music thins
A pulse felt for through garments
If I lean into the desire it starts from
If I lean unbuttoned into the blow
Of loss after loss love tossed
Into the ecstatic void
It carries me with it farther
To chords that stretch and bend
Like light through colored glass
But it races on toward shadows
Where the world I know
And the world I fear
Threaten to meet
There is always a road
The sea dark hair dolor 
Always a question
Bigger than itself
they say youre leaving Monday              
Why cant you leave on Tuesday
1 Falmouth Massachusetts 1972
Oak table knotted legs the chirp
And scrape of tines to mouth
Four children four engines
Of want That music
What did your hand mean to smooth
Across the casket of your belly
What echoed there if not metiny body
Afloat akimbo awake or at rest
Every night you fed the others
Bread leavened with the grains
Of your own want How
Could you stand me near you
In you jump and kick tricking
The heart when what you prayed for
Was my fathers shadow your name
In his dangerous script an envelope
Smelling of gunpowder bay rum
Someone to wrestle sing to question
Climb
Interstate 101 South California 1981
Remember the radio the CocaCola sign
Phosphorescent to the left bridge
After bridge as though our lives were
Engineered simply to go And so we went
Into those few quiet hours
Alone together in the dark my arm
On the rest beside yours our lights
Pricking at fog tugging us patiently
Forward like a needle through gauze
Night held us like a house
Sometimes an old song
Would fill the car like a ghost
Leroy Alabama 2005
Theres still a pond behind your mothers old house
Still a stable with horses a tractor rusted and stuck
Like a trophy in mud And the red house you might
Have thrown stones at still stands on stilts up the dirt road
A girl from the next town over rides in to lend us
Her colt cries when one of us kicks it with spurs
Her father wants to buy her a trailer let her try her luck
In the shows They stay for dinner under the tent
Your brother put up for the Fourth Firebugs flare
And vanish I am trying to let go of something
My heart cluttered with names that mean nothing
Our racket races out to the darkest part of the night
The woods catch it and send it back
But lets say youre alive again
Your hands are long and tell your age
You hold them there twirling a bent straw
And my reflection watches hollowfaced
Not trying to hide The waiters make it seem
Like Cairo Back and forth shouting
That sharp language And for the first time
I tell you everything No shame
In my secrets shoddy as laundry
I have praised your God
For the blessing of the body snuck
From pleasure to pleasure lying for it
Holding it like a coin or a key in my fist
I know now youve known all along
I wont change I want to give
Everything away To wander forever
Here is a pot of tea Lets share it
Slowly like sisters
You give me flowers resembling Chinese lanterns
You give me hale for yellow You give me vex
You give me lemons softened in brine and you give me cuttlefish ink
You give me all 463 stairs of Brunelleschis dome
You give me seduction and you let me give it back to you
You give me you
You give me an apartment full of morning smellstoasted bagel and black
coffee and the freckled lilies in the vase on the windowsill
You give me 24across
You give me flowers resembling moths wings
You give me the first bird of morning alighting on a wire
You give me the sidewalk café with plastic furniture and the boys
with their feet on the chairs
You give me the swoop of homemade kites in the park on Sunday
You give me afternooncolored beer with lemons in it
You give me DH Lawrence
and he gives me pomegranates and sorbapples
You give me the loose tooth of California the broken jaw of New York City
You give me the blue sky of Wyoming and the blue wind through it
You give me an ancient city where the language is a secret
everyone is keeping
You give me a tshirt that says all you gave me was this tshirt
You give me pictures with yourself cut out
You give me lime blossoms but not for what they symbolize
You give me yes You give me no
You give me midnight apples in a car with the windows down
You give me the flashbulbs of an electrical storm
You give me thunder and the suddenly green underbellies of clouds
You give me the careening of trains
You give me the scent of bruised mint
You give me the smell of black hair of blond hair
You give me Apollo and Daphne Pan and Syrinx
You give me Echo
You give me hyacinths and narcissus You give me foxgloves
and soft fists of peony
You give me the filthy carpet of an East Village apartment
You give me seeming not to notice
You give me an unfinished argument begun on the Manhattanbound F train
You give me paintings of women with their eyes closed
You give me grief and how to grieve
What thou lovst well shall not be reft from thee  
What thou lovst well is thy true heritage        
Youll find labels describing what is gone
an empresss bones a stolen painting
of a man in a feathered helmet
holding a flagdraped spear
A vellum gospel hidden somewhere long ago
forgotten would have sat on that pedestal
this glass cabinet could have kept the first
salts carried back from the Levant
To help us comprehend the magnitude
of absence huge rooms
lie empty of their wondersthe Colossus
Babylons Hanging Gardens and
in this gallery empty shelves enough to hold
all the scrolls of Alexandria
My love Ive petitioned the curator
who has acquired an empty chest
representing all the poems you will
now never write It will be kept with others
in the poets gallery Next door
a vacant room echoes with the spill
of jewels buried by a pirate who died
before disclosing their whereabouts
I hope you dont mind but I have kept
a few of your pieces
for my private collection I think
you know the ones I mean
Someone was searching for a Form of Fire
Birdeyed the wind watched
Four deer in a blowsy meadow
As though it were simply random a stately stare
Whats six and six and two and ten
Time that my eye ached my heart shook why
Mistaking lime for lemon
Dressed in cobalt charcoal thistleand control
If they had more they would need less
A proposal from the squinting logician
Seems we are legal seems we are ill
Ponderous purpose are you weather are you wheel
Gold with a heart of cinder
Little blue chip dancing in the light of the loom
Mistress Maygirl whom will you kiss
The death of water is the birth of air
In Mays gaud gown and ruby reckoning
the old saw wind repeats a colder thing
Says you are the bluest body I ever seen
Says dance that skeletal startle the way I might
Radius ulna a catalogue of flex
What do you think youre grabbing
with those gray hands What do you think
youre hunting catmouth creeling
in the mouseless dawn Pink as meat
in the butchers tender grip white as
the opal of a thigh you smut the lie on
In Mays red ruse and smattered ravishings
you one you two you three your cruder schemes
you blanch black lurk and blood the pallid bone
and hum scald need where the body says I am
and the rose sighs Touch me I am dying
in the pleatpetal purring of mouthweathered May
I never wish to sing again as I used to when two new eyes could
always stain the sea of tangent worlds indolent as callows and the clock
went backward for a skip to rise to set
Some will twine grass to fit in a thimble some will carve bread to
mend a craggy wall some in the slantest midnight cry for sleep When
the pitchowl swallows the moon what welt will show it Sighing helps
nothing raspberries raw and green in the form of a heart
imperfectly divided A wave grows sharper close to the shore Some
own words like strips of scape and summon It is possible to suffer even
in the sun And race the steep noon to its highest hoary gate Stares
drop under the sky silence of a windslap and a scar drifts out of air to
stand whistling
She who listens poorly will always be calling She who sounds silence
drowns with the dumb
She who cuts her hands off must drink with her tongue
I believe there is a song that is stranger than wind that sips the scald
from the telling toss toss In the room I move in a wrecked boy listened
to each skys erasing for it was shrill winter for it was blast and blur
For it was farther from the native birds and the gray heath heather and
the uncaressable thighs of the one who shook in violet Those who fly
farthest must always burn the nest But the mind in its implacable spec
trum dims to brown Must you die on your back like a cheap engine rust
and wrack In the crevicing days there are no words for prizing be
tween the lidless moon and the silver hands of the fountain But if it is
space you must fail in teach it din
His daughter pulls on
her fathers frayed dishdasha
to go check the bees
Today she doesnt
carry the smoke canister
with her to the field
She opens a tray
while talking down their high whine
breaks off honeycomb
and rubs it over
her face and hair over white cloth down to her feet
Each of her hands holds the crumbling comb like a sponge
while she waits for them When the first one comes
she feels wings against her toes a tongue unscrolling
She wills herself not to laugh as the next alights on her neck tickling
her hairs as it walks Then they descend to shoulders forearms chest thighs eyes
she shutsshe feels the thousand tongues on the cloth Featherlike wings churn
in her ears rustle and hum with agitated talk Never been so loved
Her fathers alive
            shes a torch of burning bees
                                    tears course across cheeks
When her mother sees
            the apparition of bees
                                    walking towards their door
she falls on her knees
            It is the end of the world
                                    But when the angel
speaks with her daughters
            voice shes not amazed Mama
                                    how do I end this
Her mother brushes
            bees away from her eyes pulls
                                    them from her hair and
undresses her child
            hanging the winged dishdasha
                                    on the clothes line
Carries her naked
            girl into the house to bathe
                                    The beelike angels
take all day to strip
            honey from the robe return
                                    it to their tiered home
Before the moths have even appeared
to orbit around them the streetlamps come on
a long row of them glowing uselessly
along the ring of garden that circles the city center
where your steps count down the dulling of daylight
At your feet a bee crawls in small circles like a toy unwinding
Summer specializes in time slows it down almost to dream
And the noisy day goes so quiet you can hear
the bedraggled man who visits each trash receptacle
mutter in disbelief Everything in the world is being thrown away
Summer lingers but its about ending Its about how things
redden and ripen and burst and come down Its when
city workers cut down trees demolishing
one limb at a time spilling the crumbs
of twigs and leaves all over the tablecloth of street
  Sunglasses the man softly exclaims
while beside him blooms a large gray rose of pigeons
huddled around a dropped piece of bread
Eyes wide like an owls an aspirinpale face
foretells in lamplight how it accumulates age
Somewhat masked somewhat naked theres no way
to know what others see when looking at it
All five of the bodys senses crowd
on this small planet a weather of hair surrounds
My face is not a democracythe eyes are tyrants
and the ears are radical dissenters
In the conversations of eyebrows mine are whispers
Like the window at night the face reflects too
uncertain how to change when greeting itself
and is it not cruel when anothers face
wont reflect acknowledgment of you
My mother my father and my brother are found
in the blurring of feature and expression
Cynicism finds no purchase here
the same cannot be said for sadness
and look deeperanger hides in the jaw
And while the nose quietly broods
like an actor rehearsing his soliloquy
the empty page of the forehead when I raise my brows
fills suddenly with questions
No one saw the first ones
swim ashore centuries ago
nudged by waves into the marsh grasses
When you look into their faces there is no trace
of the ship seized with terror the crashing waves
and the horses cries when thrown overboard
Every afternoon you ride your bicycle to the pasture
to watch the twitch of their manes and ivory tails
unroll a carpet of silence to see ponies lost in dream
But it isnt dream that place
your mind drifts to that museum of memory
inventoried in opposition to the present
You felt it once on a plane
taking off from a city you didnt want to leave
the stranded moment when the plane lifts into the clouds
Thats not dream its not even sleeping
It is the nature of sleeping to be unaware
This was some kind of waiting for the world to come back
Freedom is a rocket
isnt it bursting
orgasmically over
parkloads of hot
dog devouring
human beings
or into the cities
of our enemies
without whom we
would surely
kill ourselves
though they are
ourselves and
America I see now
is the soldier
who said I saw
something
burning on my
chest and tried
to brush it off with
my right hand
but my arm
wasnt there
America is no
other than this
moment the
burning ribcage
the hand gone
that might have
put it out the skies
afire with our history
for Pat Silliman
I
Hard dreams The moment at which you recognize that your own death lies
in wait somewhere within your body A lone ship defines the horizon The
rain is not safe to drink
In Grozny in Bihac the idea of history shudders with each new explosion
The rose lies unattended wild thorns at the edge of a mass grave Between
classes over strong coffee young men argue the value of a pronoun
When this you see remember Note in a bottle bobs in a cartoon sea The
radio operators name is Sparks
Hand outlined in paint on a brick wall Storm turns playground into a
swamp Finally we spot the wood duck on the middle lake
The dashboard of my car like the keyboard of a piano Toy animals anywhere
Sun swells in the morning sky
Man with three pens clipped to the neck of his sweatshirt shuffles from one
table to the next seeking distance from the cold January air out the coffee
house door tall Styrofoam cup in one hand Of Grammatology in the other
Outside a dog is tied to any empty bench bike chained to the No Parking
sign

A guide to the sky under full nondisclosure
Dawn in the bare birch trees the sun swollen throbs over the horizon Hotel
buffet doodah Two dogs dancing sniffing one anothers genitalia
One can hear the electricity wired in the walls water rushing through the
pipes the boards and joints of the old house groaning as they settle
Map of morning Winter light Ones experience of the transfer point air
port as that of the city itself Dear winter its 515 AM Shoes for Mickey
Mouse
Waste deep in the big muddy The sound of rain around The line not visible
binds letters into words People are drowning
Moon broken in the middle What a watch watches Song of the single en
gine Cessna threading the predawn sky One bird one bird many
Blades of grass brittle in the freeze Spiders corner of the bath room One
maple tree that will not return to life
There is a chair
the heart of which
is wooden
split five ways
and grass pressed flat
where we kissed
where others later kissed
on the same mattress
and solemn nothing
happening under a canopy
Have you forgotten me
I will go down wonderfully
as was told in proverbs
though for a long time I thought
I should not go
Here are things that have
no Latin names

                                                            from Remarks on Color
These islands lie off the west coast of Ireland
as if nothing matters
The people have lived here for centuries
with only a thin covering of soil over the surface
Great use is made of the seaweed
the cattle swimming out
The women here are justly famous
They weave their own tweed
and make a type of belt called criss
The heavy Atlantic seas
the slip stitch
The difficulty of the patterns
are never written down
Most impressive and rich the trellis pattern
and the rope the tribute to the hardworking bee
But sometimes their knitting shows mistakes
with a true Irish touch of nothing
really matters a careless nonchalance
of the crossing of their cables
And note mistakes in the simple patterns
forked lightning or cliff paths
small fields fenced with stone
the ups and downs of married life
the mosses
The openwork has a religious
significance or none
Sometimes the clarity of the pattern is
lost through the use of
very fine wool
Green from the mosses brown
from the seaweed grey and cream
color from the stones and pebbles
many are distinctly overbobbled
No matter They are too lovely
to be lost Wool and knitting
leaflets can be obtained
In no case is the whole pattern given
There are certain gaps and yawns
and part of the pattern is left out
as if it doesnt matter
or was too lovely
so was lost
Some of the simple patterns
are charming for childrens jerseys
This one for example
would be lovely on a child
We called off the search
and the weary climbed down from the glacier
with their dogs exhausted in the spring sun
too tired to eat the ice in their paws
We had called his name mostly for show
a ritual that kept us moving in the high bowls
their stunted pines predating the flood
in the steep ravines sliding loose with scree
loudly at first then speaking it to each other
then spelling it out on forms required by law
It is a form of praying he claimed to walk
out to the very edge of your life Every time
the reply comes clear as a stone
at our thin crowns It misses
almost every time humming as it goes
i Awake
Each entry consisting of the statements I am awake or I am conscious
entered every few minutes
        210 pm this time properly awake       214 pm this time finally awake       235 pm this time completely awake
       At 940 pm I awoke for the first time despite my previous claims
This in turn was crossed out followed by
     I was fully conscious at 1035 pm and awake for the first time                  in many many weeks
This in turn was cancelled out by the next entry
  ii Passport
How large it grew that first kiss until I could board it each night
a raft drifting out into the quiet lake After twenty years
the great amnesiac HM never recognized
his doctor and after lunch
gladly ate another Time for lunch they would tell him again
You must be starving
God I am starving
Without a body collection cannot precede
recollection recollect a tongue that skilled swirl
of its quick tip a mouthful of familiars smoke
strawberry candy Memory in the web
between dumbstruck and dura dump and dune
duplicates What kind of game is this
Im no longer a boy
HM would say to his reflection the surprise on his face
genuine What kind of game is this
The mirror a passport like any other its picture
out of time a foreign shock of untamed hair
even the photographer declared beautiful then
  Then the word smiles
like a stranger on your first day at school
sitting on stone steps worn with use
  iii Taxonomy
Red but not bird comes to mind
                 Only the kingdom of living names
was missing therebank flagstone sofa
                 remained but not the blur at the feeder
the undersea creature on the card
                  its a danger a killer swimmer
they coaxed himits called a
                  waiting for the word to stir from its depth
how could he forget the ones who dressed
                  fed taught him word by word
the order of the world What noise does
                  that loss make They looked suspiciously
like his parents he thought strangers posing
                  unanswerable questions
It has no name it has no need
Because I feel that in the Heavens above
The angels whispering to one another
Can find among their burning terms of love
None so devotional as that of Mother
Therefore by that dear name I long have called you
You who are more than mother unto me
And fill my heart of hearts where Death installed you
In setting my Virginias spirit free
My mothermy own mother who died early
Was but the mother of myself but you
Are mother to the one I loved so dearly
And thus are dearer than the mother I knew
By that infinity with which my wife
Was dearer to my soul than its soullife
Why speak of hate when I do bleed for love
Not hate my love but Love doth bite my tongue
Till I taste stuff that makes my rhyming rough
So flatter I my fever for the one
For whom I inly mourn though seem to shun
A rose is arrows is eros so what
If I confuse the shade that Ive become
With winedark substance in a lovers cup
But stop my tonguely wound Ive bled enough
If I be fair or false or freaked with fear
If I my tongue in lockèd box immure
Blame not me for I am sick with love
     Yet would I be your friend most willingly
     Since friendship would infect me killingly
Trying to see the proportional relation
Of one memory to another
One is so strange and then
To try and see what looms
And doesnt for the other person
Who was there it gets stranger
Especially when youve read
His email
I dont know how people
Understand their lives measure
Their sensations against objective
Or sotospeak democratic estimations
Whether people accept the externality
Of events events as things
That happen to them I refuse
To accept some coagulate
Of other peoples
Impressions in exchange for this
Privacy no matter how flawed it is
This is lyric poetry It has to be It has
No other hope What was it
About you and me that made whatever
Happen to us In New York
Everything fell apart What I dreaded
And expected
But still Tonight
It is dark and the weather is cooler
Than its been It has taken
A while for Fall to break the global
Warming kept me in summer
Love with you like I was under a
Fermata Now that the times
Are changing I feel
Even more for you or I feel nothing
I cant tell its kind
Of scary I was sick of thinking
About you this morning but
I was listening to Bob Dylan and Leonard
Cohen in order to think about
You for literary purposes
When I feel nothing for a person
I get scared Im losing my humanity
And that turning cold means
My hearts been botoxed were
All fucked
I watched a movie on YouTube
Called Ladies and Gentlemen MisterLeonard Cohen that was made when
He was still just a poet and only
Famous in Canada
Hes a pretentious little nerd
In it selfimportant teachers pet wit
I think that making music he became
So much nakeder much more desperate
The talent real even pure evenNatural had to ripen in
The artificial man
Alain Badiou on the day
Of his class said Because an event
Is pure rapture an event disappears
Immediately it does not exist
Objectively but only by appearing
And disappearing This is both
Precise and vague it is attractive
I guess I guess since you and me did not
Disappear immediately it was
Not pure rapture not in these
Terms but my smile
Was real each time I swallowed
Your cum Getting
Fucked by you was great I could
Feel it in my organs but
You didnt make me go insane
Except for maybe once
Or twice Actually maybe I am
Being unfair Maybe the fucking really
Was that great In this moment I
Cant remember
I just read a poetry
Review in which the reviewer
States that a certain book
Made his cock feel as though
It were tall as a tree Thats
Nice I have no idea
What it feels like to have
A cock Sometimes I feel
As though Im getting close
To understanding and then
Something happens to make
Me have no clue again When Sinan
Fucks me we lose our individuality
So severely its like were both
Gasping after an animal thats his
Cock that is beyond us and I lose
All sense of the world His cocks
Not even him and hes not him either
And we arent anything
Its strange the possessive Didnt Thomas
Mann write a book called HerrUnd Hund or something like that
Mans best friend What belongs
To him Me and Sunder
Talked about how scary and arousing
It is to watch men masturbate cos
Everyone relates differently to his
Like dicks are always almost but never
Quite another Je est un autre
Said that brat Arthur Rimbaud
I am definitely in love with you
As I write this You are so petty
And superfluous I cannot stand
You Sinan is definitely
In love with me I know because
I saw him tonight I love
Him too You are gracious
To accord me the space and time
In which to develop or to elaborate
Upon as the French say these
Extreme emotions I am despite
The odds and certain lapses
So capable of feeling
It was good to slap
Your face and to admit
That your asshole
Made me nervous
Your eyes had a way
Of going soft and shiny
When you said the really
Tender things We admitted
It was intimidating
For us both to hear each other describe
People weve fucked and been
In love with Im proud of what
We accomplished together Alain Badiou
Ended his class with a reading
Of Ariane et BarbeBleue which
Is an opera by Paul Dukas You
And me had gone pretty far
By the time this day came and
Something very fragile in me breaks
When somebody says my name or
Even a variant of it I was tired
I think Badiou discusses Ariane
In Being and Event which
I have not read In class he said
That the story of the opera is
About the relationship between law
And freedom and that it shows
That the desire for freedom is not
So simple Ariane experiences an Event
That causes her to demand freedom Badiou
Said but she is unable to convince anybody
Else any other women to want freedom she ends up alone
She genuinely falls in love with the wicked
Bluebeard at the beginning Bluebeard
Who previously got women by having a castle
To lock them in This woman Ariane
Does not have to be taken
By force When she enters
His castle he hands
Her seven keys six
Of which he gives her permission
To use and leaves She hears the cries
Of his other imprisoned wives
Coming from behind a door So she uses
The forbidden key releasing them
Meanwhile Bluebeard is assaulted
By the local peasants who want
To free Ariane fearing her fate will turn out like
That of the women who came before her
But Ariane is already free
In herself and proves this freedom
By bringing the wounded Bluebeard
Home caring tenderly for him and then
Declaring that shes leaving him for good
By the end Bluebeards shattered sobbing
Bleeding Ariane
Invites the other wives to leave with her
In a wrenching aria pleading
With them one by one to taste
With her the freedom awaiting
Them The World But they all prefer confinement
Even though they had longed
For freedom before Ariane opened
Their door Once liberty arrived they were no
Longer capable of it preferring to serve even a gutted
Hollowedout power Ariane exits
Alone The end Badiou narrated
This with emotion and
I cried Maybe cos I was tired and
That thing about my name or because
I am not heroic or free
I had missed half of Alain Badious
Lectures messing around with you
On the couch by the fire in the womens
Toilets up on the hill If this were a suitable parable
And it isnt I would try to tell myself
That those very early mornings in Brooklyn when I sat
Up in your bed feeling wrong and
Got dressed and walked away I should
Have stayed away cos I dont need you
Maybe I dont need you But I want
You Maybe I dont love you But
I am getting to know you Maybe
What made me cry in class was how tired
I was and how sad and hard
It is and how rare to undertake an act
Thats truly free and not just a response
To a confused surge of drives and  fears
Just now I touched my chest
And felt my heart quivering there
This must be one of the bad times 
I think it is quivering with remorse
And exhaustion Once I saw a heart
Beating in a documentary I was a very 
Little girl and the sight disgusted me
Throbbing and not stopping my heart betrays
Me and yet remains sure and true a thing 
Of nature Earth bleeding
Its guts out on the sea floor exhausts
Me with remorse and shame and yet I have to trust it 
As wealth is proven by how terribly it devastates
Itself and I am but one symptom among billions of the wealth
Of Earth A tired feeling that is recuperated by a passing spaceship 
Or an infinitude like fame but more universal I will have to miss you
Earth I miss you already And yet when I touch myself whom I should
Not trust it is still only the heaviest and most jealous feelings that bind me to you like blood
Eight stars make A soft solfege  Above this motel Where there are never  Stars I let a skinny man  Put his long thick dick in me for you So we could break our hearts  The way you want me to Somewhere a white Wall stretches up behind the backs of a tribe  Whose obscurity protects its secret from the common World and the connivances it ordains  What time is it What season is it I dont know  The moon blows green Gas into my skull  I want to hide what I dream In a big boot and wear the boot  And starve as I lean upon the boot of my destitution And drag  The truth as a gimp would drag the weight of her body That would give me a feeling of honesty
Love
Is an interruption or an aberration a force in opposition to the ultimate inertia
of the universe 
Wrote Marguerite Duras 
Whether or not it is worth it it occurs Whether or not it is to be believed it is 
The wind moves us without a frond being needed to be held by a slave girl 
The rudiments of sentences are ancient without a mouth needing to remember
what it is losing as it lets those words out something eviller than what they
even mean right now something too evil to be known right now 
Or ever 
I feel sure that even the most culpable people have other qualities secreted
away 
Adjusting their garments in light of fate 
He turned his head upward he looked up the white wall The light from the
lamp could be light coming from a great distance it could be a great distance
away and the wall could be snow it is so beautiful he said His head looking
up the wall his eyes looking up it he said that nail in the wall could also be
beautiful for so far away
A heave of afternoon light pulls a tulip from the turf a bower for locusts a cup of shells The farmhouse tilts a bent shadow on wheels In cedar rooms a family is molded silent wrapped in the wire of steel eyes and stopped voice romantic ash This is not my house my ghost my uninvited guest my lost labor of love my thicket or grease my JPEG gessoed or rawhide suit The yellow light throbs like an internal organ  soft body of an overture to insect sounds  sapling of a new world  whose future awaits me at the tilting window of my own domestic hut Perhaps this is my mesh of hours my muscular ache my guardian sash twist of rope carved around an old maple trunk my rod of power red with anticipatory friction at the edge of an emerging set of planetary rings Stained ochre by the air I pitch forward a vanillascented pear that floats or falls In the rattan chair on the front porch by the blistered boards of the front door a figure of tar watches Cool dust sparkles and settles Shadows have made me visible An empty wagon flares on the hillside
Transfixed to the by the on the congruities who is herself a vanishing point coming to closure  dusky flutter  trilling away like a watchdog on drugged sop channeling her mother and grandmother whove engraved on her locket phrases in script glide on a blade and rustling precedes the shuck This is not my teeming fate my rind my roiling ellipsis or valedictory spray of myrrh Always its morning afternoon or evening  the loot of hours  a magic sack grasping vacuum but heavy in the hand and from which together we pull a swarm of telepathic bees melons beached in a green bin a lithograph of the city from its crumbling ramparts crackled pitchers and the mouth of a cave Perhaps this is my open weave my phantom rialto or plume of light We bow to each other in the mash of flickering things We are completely surrounded
Once we were in the loop    slick with information and the luster of good timing We folded our clothes Once we stood up before the standing vigils before the popping vats before the annotated lists of marshaled forces with their Venn diagrams like anxious zygotes their paratactic chasms    before the set of whirligig blades modular torrent We folded our clothes Once we remembered to get up to pee    and how to pee in a gleaming bowl    soaked as we were in gin and coconut licorice water with catalpa buds golden beet syrup in Johnny Walker Blue and a beautiful blur like August fog cantilevered over the headlands    We tucked into the crevices of the mattress pad twirling our auburn braids or woke up at the nick of light and practiced folding our clothes Our pod printed headbands with hourly updates announcing the traversals of greenshouldered hawks through the downtown loop of gillyfish threading the north canals of the discovery of electron calligraphy or a new method of washing brine We smoothed our feathers like birds do and twitched ourselves into warm heaps and followed the fourth hand on the platinum clocks sweeping in arcs from left to right up and down in and out    We were steeped in watchfulness fully suspended itinerant floaters  ocean of air  among  the ozone lily pads and imbrex domes the busting thickets of nutmeg and geode malls At night we told stories about the future with clairvoyant certainty Our clothing was spectacular and fit to a T We admired each other with ferocity
I left you last evening without the usual privileges A lot of what my body was was toxin that held me aloft in idle price far from the witless wood and Arcadia Theres no more moon for birds to buss at over streetlamps Urchins make their way in the mist trolling for dinner rolls How frugal my recent times were spent the clocks keeping how stoned a content Therell be much better dawns than this forthcoming
Nowsilver morning body trussed across a spherewhat would Salome do A certain Grace is coming toward you and xe is lovely The troposphere might solder the iron we sought here the sky is neither an abaude
What Portia lacks is not anatomical but philosophical bitter is my sustenance melancholy my food sorry my wine Expressive geometrics of the New York sissyand with such a disfunctional phone Portia tells her students get thee to a muhfuckery where Ill lay thee fool across my lap
P meets Sallys longings her shoes untied and everything about her demonstrating a careless desolation a blue eye and sunken Take one step further and the Grace coming toward you is Beauty The Grace turned away from you is Restraint Hassan pleading for her life fainting having a bucket of water thrown on her reviving
Nothing but a farce we animate Wall and Moon The art is cruxy to the lovejuice Once there was many a sight but now they are wilting poor lambs Once a malapert downpour uncharacteristic of the rains of this place Next football a hemistich The belle lettrists idea of a billetdoux the scientists idea of a sauna
What with their consummate barbeque wines their tawdry dance moves their gogo girls of yesteryearwe thought the Impressionists were trying to impress people Fezan impossibility the universe grew out of Flaubert saying Madame Bovary cest moi Loeretta casting her lots
What makes that fox so grabby for the stars
Begging like boys do I meant to fully
Gild that lily till less like virile Mars
Its clepd the pansiest of pansy
The caducous calyx of a poppy
Cuz step into these arms where you belong
A coup at the prospect of this lording
A gleam in the gloom with serpentine song
The phosphorescent tides mine to lavish upon
O stop me at the very vestibule
Before whom and in what habit I speak
I watched them use their meat to call me fool
Someones cage is aching at the seams
The noisome idle falls to dirty dreams
Thus the flummoxed drunk of xem will coil
And Ill learn the real or itll learn me
Making free with the Italian model
The single summer shower mano à mano
The proverbial number of angels
That couldve fit on the head of a pin
Are crying to the myriad angles
This glassy labyrinth we happened in
Will not undo the errancer Ive been
Soon the swancrest the feedcrest my distress
Will feign to fuck the furlonged mannequin
At whatpunishing pace we undress
This crapshoot idée fixe and its yahoo mistress
Fictive trees harsh the billow of my cape
All kind of lovers crashed rubbernecking
The fishes on the frontispiece were draped
In your leafy worded velocity
You whisper London has no more fog for me
To whit my darksome peachpit storms above
A buckler to them that walks uprightly
Will not enforce this porno hand from glove
Or diminish one jott my vegetable love
I could make a wardrobe with tufts of wool caught on thistle and brackenLostthe scraps I might have woven whole clothCome watch the man says shearing sheep with the precision of long practice fleece removed all of a piece rolled in a neat bundleIve been so clumsy with people whove loved meStraddling a ewe the man props its head on his foot leans down with clippers each pass across the coat a caressHis dogs lying nearby tremble at every moveas I do loving the hands that have learned to gentle the life beneath them
Your pansies died again today All June Ive watched them scorch and fall by noon their faces folding down to tissuepaper triangles I bring them back with water words a pinch but they are sick to death of resurrection You planted them last fall these Chillers guaranteed to come again in spring They returned in Aprilyou did not You who said pick all you want it just makes more one day in 1963 and I a daughter raised on love and miracles believed it
I killed a great silver fish cut him open with a longthin knife The river carried his heart away I took hisdead eyes home His red flesh sang to me on the fire I builtin my backyard His taste was the lost memory of mywildness Behind amber clouds of cedar smoke Oriondrew his bow A black moon rose from the nights dark watersa sliver of its bright face reflecting back into the universe
My mother sends the baby pictures she promised egg hunting in Shelby Park wooden blocks and Thumbelina tossed on the rug knotty pine walls in a house lost to memory I separate outthe early ones studying my navel or crumbs on the tray taken before my awareness of Sylvania Superflash Here I am sitting on the dinette table the near birthday cake striking me dumb Two places of wedding china two glasses of milk posed for the marvelous moment the child squishes the fluted rosettes mother claps her hands father snaps the picture in the face of time When the sticky sweetis washed off the page we are pasted in an album of blessed amnesia The father leaves the pine house and sees the child on weekends the mother stores the china on the top shelf until its dull and crazed the saucereyed girl grips her curved spoon like theres no tomorrow
Stay I said to the cut flowers They bowed their heads lowerStay I said to the spider who fledStay leaf It reddened embarrassed for me and itselfStay I said to my body It sat as a dog does obedient for a moment soon starting to trembleStay to the earth of riverine valley meadows of fossiled escarpments of limestone and sandstone It looked back with a changing expression in silenceStay I said to my loves Each answered Always
I didnt think handsome then I thought my father the way he saunters down Main Street housewives shopkeepers mechanics calling out children running up to get Lifesavers The way he pauses to chat flipping his lighter open tamping the Lucky Strike on his thumbnailI sneak into his den when hes out tuck into the kneehole of his desk and sniff his Zippo until dizzy emboldened then play little tricks mixing red and black inks in his fountain pen twisting together paperclips If I lift the telephone receiverquietly I can listen in on our party line Thats how I hear two women talking about him Thats why my mother finds me that night sleepwalking sobbing Its all right she tells meyou had a nightmare come to bed
Deeply repentant of my sinful waysAnd of my trivial manifold desiresOf squandering alas these few brief daysOf fugitive life in tending loves vain firesTo Thee Lord Who dost move hard hearts againAnd render warmth unto the frozen snowAnd lighten every bitter load of painFor those who with Thy sacred ardours glow   To Thee I turn O stretch forth Thy right handAnd from this whirlpool rescue me for IWithout Thine aid could never reach the landO willingly for us didst suffer lossAnd to redeem mankind hung on the CrossO gentle Saviour leave me not to die
Her hair was curls of Pleasure and DelightWhich on her brow did cast a glistening lightAs lace her bashful eyelids downward hungA modest countenance oer her face was flungBlushes as coral beads she strung to wearAbout her neck and pendants for each earHer gown was by Proportion cut and madeWith veins embroidered with complexion laidRich jewels of pure honor she did wear By noble actions brightened everywhereThus dressed to Fames great court straightways she wentTo dance a brawl with Youth Love Mirth Content
I language want to dress my fancies in The hairs uncurled the garments loose and thinHad they but silver lace to make them gayTheyd be more courted than in poor array Or had they art would make a better showBut they are plain yet cleanly do they goThe world in bravery doth take delightAnd glistering shows do more attract the sight And every one doth honor a rich hoodAs if the outside made the inside goodAnd every one doth bow and give the place Not for the mans sake but the silver laceLet me intreat in my poor books behalfThat all will not adore the golden calfConsider pray gold hath no life thereinAnd life in nature is the richest thingBe just let Fancy have the upper placeAnd then my verses may perchance find grace
Sir Charles into my chamber coming inWhen I was writing of my Fairy QueenI praysaid hewhen Queen Mab you do seePresent my service to her MajestyAnd tell her I have heard Fames loud reportBoth of her beauty and her stately courtWhen I Queen Mab within my fancy viewedMy thoughts bowed low fearing I should be rudeKissing her garment thin which fancy madeI knelt upon a thought like one that prayed And then in whispers soft I did presentHis humble service which in mirth was sentThus by imagination I have beenIn Fairy court and seen the Fairy Queen
In gardens sweet each flower mark did IHow they did spring bud blow wither and dieWith that contemplating of mans short staySaw man like to those flowers pass awayYet built he houses thick and strong and highAs if hed live to all EternityHoards up a mass of wealth yet cannot fillHis empty mind but covet will he stillTo gain or keep such falsehood will he useWrong right or truthno base ways will refuseI would not blame him could he death out keepOr ease his pains or be secure of sleepOr buy Heavens mansionslike the gods becomeAnd with his gold rule stars and moon and sunCommand the winds to blow seas to obeyLevel their waves and make their breezes stayBut he no power hath unless to dieAnd care in life is only miseryThis care is but a word an empty soundWherein there is no soul nor substance found Yet as his heir he makes it to inherit And all he has he leaves unto this spiritTo get this Child of Fame and this bare wordHe fears no dangers neither fire nor sword All horrid pains and death he will endureOr any thing can he but fame procure O man O man what high ambition growsWithin his brain and yet how low he goesTo be contented only with a soundWherein is neither peace nor life nor body found
A Poet am I neither born nor bredBut to a witty poet marriedWhose brain is fresh and pleasant as the SpringWhere Fancies grow and where the Muses sing There oft I lean my head and listening harkTo catch his words and all his fancies markAnd from that garden show of beauties takeWhereof a posy I in verse may make Thus I that have no gardens of my ownThere gather flowers that are newly blown
I am being paraded through the streets with my head shaved
with no memory of what I have done to deserve this
I run a gauntlet of women who call me slut and whore
staggering under their fusillade of accusation
What stories did I tell what lies What names did I reveal
What men did I sleep with What did I do For what reward
Or in a catacomb deep under Paris they press gloves
of barbed wire on to my bare hands and when the wounds have healed
they point to the brambles left on my palms saying Surely
these lines of head and heart and mind are those of a traitor
When you wake I hold you tight saying Its only a dream
the language of dream has nothing to do with that of life
And as eventually you sink back into the deep well
of sleep I wonder if by my words I have betrayed you
I woke You were lying beside me in the double bed
prone your long dark hair fanned out over the downy pillow
Id been dreaming we stood on a beach an ocean away
watching the waves purl into their troughs and tumble over
Knit one purl two you said Something in your voice made me think
of women knitting by the guillotine Your eyes met mine
The fetch of a wave is the distance it travels you said
from where it is born at sea to where it founders to shore
I must go back to where it all began You waded in
thighdeep waistdeep breastdeep headdeep until you disappeared
I lay there and thought how glad I was to find you again
You stirred in the bed and moaned something I heard a footfall
on the landing the rasp of a mans cough He put his head
around the door He had my face I woke You were not there
You remember the Incredible Shrinking Man I said
Well last night I dreamed I was him It began the same way
The shirt cuffs were the first thing that came to my attention
drooping down over my knuckles in the bedroom mirror      
And my waistband and shoes were getting looser by the day
Within weeks you could perch me on your knee like a male doll
Later you would put me to bed in the empty matchbox
You failed to watch for the spider that came to explore me
I fought her with a darning needle a button my shield
She retreated from me on a thread I followed her down
to the cellar How I made my way back Ill never know
It took me days to travel over the quilt to your hand
No longer a hand but an Alpine range of sleeping flesh
I crawled into an open pore and entered your bloodstream
Forget the corncrakes elegy Rusty
Iambics that escaped your discipline
Of shorn lawns it is sustained by nature
It does not grieve for you nor for itself
You remember the rolled gold of cornfields
Their rustling of tinsel in the wind
A whole field quivering like blown silk
A shiver now runs through the laurel hedge
And washing flutters like the swaying lines
Of a new verse The high fidelity
Music of the newlywed obscures your
Dedication to a life of loving
Money What could they be for those marble
Toilet fixtures the silence of waterbeds
That book of poems you bought yesterday
They had questioned him for hours Who exactly was he And when
He told them they questioned him again When they accepted who he was as
Someone not involved they pulled out his fingernails Then
They took him to a wasteground somewhere near the Horseshoe Bend and told him
What he was They shot him nine times
A dark umbilicus of smoke was rising from a heap of burning tyres
The bad smell he smelt was the smell of himself Broken glass and knotted Durex
The knuckles of a face in a nylon stocking I used to see him in the Gladstone Bar
Drawing pints for strangers his almost perfect fingers flecked with scum
The PowersthatBe decreed that from theofthe sausage rolls for reasons
Of security would be contracted to a different firm They gave the prisoners no reasons
The prisoners complained We cannot reproduce his actual words here since their spokesman is alleged
To be a subcommander of a movement deemed to be illegal
An actor spoke for him in almostperfect lipsynch Its not the quality Were giving off about Just that it seems theyre getting smaller Were talking quantity 
His Belfast accent wasnt West enough Is the H in HBlock aitch or haitch
Does it matter What we have we hold Our day will come Give or take an inch
Well give an inch and someone takes an effing mile Everything is in the ways
You say them Like the prison that we call Long Kesh is to the PowersthatBe The Maze
It was overcast No hour at all was indicated by the gnomon
With difficulty I made out the slogan Time and tide wait for no man
I had been waiting for you Daphne underneath the dripping laurels near
The sundial glade where first we met I felt like Hamlet on the parapets of Elsinore
Alerted to the ectoplasmic moment when Luna rends her shroud of cloud
And sails into a starry archipelago Then your revenant appeared and spake aloud
  I am not who you think I am For what we used to be is gone The moments over  Whatever years you thought we spent together You dont know the story And moreover    You mistook the drinkingfountain for a sundial I put my lips to its whatever
And with difficulty I made out the slogan Drink from me and you shall live forever
Near the year

Maximos Planudes
nude
writing to a friend
in Asia Minor
asking for parchment
because the right quality
is not for sale
in his own neighborhood
presumably Constantinople
In the end
all he receives
are some asses skins
which do not please
him in the least
and a note Dear Max
                                                      No parchment
                                                      till the summer
                                                      months after the population

                                                      Low yield
                                                      should come as no surprise
                                                      our medieval animals
                                                      being much smaller
                                                      than their modern

This is the room
Where mole guests are welcomed
At this moment you see the wedding table prepared for the mole guests
Rooms are heated with stoves
Rooms have been designed according to the patriarchal way of living
The family has consists of father mather sons and brides
There is no sex discrimination within the family
They artogether have meal and altogether chat but when the doors are clased
Mole guests are welcomed in Selamlik part
Femole guests are welcomed in Harem part
On such occasions mole guests are served via the cupboard in the wall
               which turns on its axis
O dove fly to Aleppo with my Byzantine ode
And take my greeting to my kinsman

Before I was born I saw a tissue of ingenious detours an inextricable tangle
wreathed with mistake
Perhaps the ghost does not limp away but rather forests flee me frightened
Look they are setting a place for loss clearing the table for the first glow of
antiquity
Here we see William T Walters in his little library illuminated carefully
smoothing the lip of the continent
What form bounds forward from behind but The Atlantic Railroad Coastline Co
The whole Roman Empire was sold by ascending auction in 193 AD
A globe enclosed Bottomless years The train has stopped on the platform and no
one is there for these are the Public Days when the Poor Association claims the
museums building
As if bound by the knots of invention I found a wrong road dotted with weeds
and sorrows
Perhaps the universe is an extinguished building
with blue banners strung along
and the forest more like a commodity
bordering bushes and asphalt
something else to string our blue banners on
Never was restoration swifter
the leafless trees the asphalt
less splintered and more splendid
Never was restoration swifter
with its mightier solutions
less splintered and more splendid
snipers dynamiters colorful bombs
We please ourselves with mightier solutions
picnics under blue spruces
snipers dynamiters colorful bombs
the guardians of what we might call home rights
At picnics under blue spruces
we clamor after the news
and its employees the guardians of home rights
the media mustering one mind
Its news
the decision to nobly save rather than meanly lose
some pretense of mustering one mind
secures its truth
The decision to nobly save rather than meanly lose
our flag
secures its truth
as a squirrel secures its nuts by hiding them in the ground
Our flag
a souvenir of having been here before
a squirrels nuts deep in the ground
But travel travail and The Methods mistakes
all souvenirs of having been here before
haunt us and taunt us and call us names 
But travail travel and Methods mistakes
mark a different season nuts rotting bulbs blooming
Each season haunts us and taunts us and calls us names
until finally the universe is an extinguished building
a different season nuts rotting bulbs blooming
and the forest a commodity
In the very night of movement where I
sought a sequential self 
The sea as blood thought as
Earth that changes the sea
Changes the fishes in it
for the fortunes of landscapes
are in the fantasies
of architecture
H         taught to sing
siren scales by ear
by rote or immersion
abroad
In the discrepancy of double exposure
Casts of light crack times microscope
I had a boyfriend who told me stories about his family how an argument once ended when his father seized a lit birthday cake in both hands and hurled it out a secondstory window ThatI thought was what a normal family was like anger sent out across the sill landing like a gift to decorate the sidewalk below In mine it was fists and direct hits to the solar plexusand nobody ever forgave anyone But I believed the people in his stories really loved one another even when they yelled and shoved their feet through cabinet doors or held a chair like a bottle of cheap champagne christening the wallrungs exploding from their holes I said it sounded harmless the pomp and fury of the passionate He said it was a curse being born Italian and Catholic and when he looked from that window what he saw was the moment rudely crushed But all I could see was a gorgeous threelayer cake gliding like a battered ship down the sidewalk the smoking candles broken sunk deep in the icing a few still burning
Except a sixyear pony penned from birthinside a barn I never seen anything worse
Eleven dobermans and mixed breeds some still pups
removed from a residence after anonymous tips
about a dead dog decomposing on the porchStill and yet this many dogs almost beats that one horse
The problem of human freedom one might couch
in other terms than Kants Its nasty in thereDog shit everywhere I dont see how she could breathe
The woman nearly ninety wept and pleaded
with the workers Ive been raising dogs right herein this very house since before your mothers were bornIf Im treating these dogs as bad as you sayhow come you need those chokers to drag them away
The Humane Society trucks radio left on
played Me and Bobby McGee They were strays unwantedI fed them and gave them a home Now youll kill themand call me cruel And who will protect meHow will I sleep When asked the welfare worker
said the woman cannot be forced from her home
But freedom of will is not freedom from necessity
and obligation The neighbors lost interest soon
and left her lawn Meanwhile a breeze blows in
from the Gulf on a girl showing her friends the spot where
she lost her left foot to a shark He kept twisting itlike a dog with a rag she says just to hear them squealReally he only managed to take a chunk and maulthe rest but the doctors had to amputate
She had to learn to trust loss And in Houston
a boy tries to jimmy a padlock with a broom
to free his sixyearold sister from the storage shed
their parents told them was the naughty roomShe was causing trouble at school wetting her bedand threatening to run away We made a decisionWe thought a few hours here was best for her
Police said the girl had been left water
A person may purchase the wind and the sun
at the price of perpetual peregrination
For Christs sake
learn to type
and have something
to fall back on
Be someone
make something of yourself
look at Gertrudo Ganley
Always draw the curtains
when the lights are on
Have nothing to do
with the Shantalla gang
get yourself a right man
with a Humber Sceptre
For Christs sake
wash your neck
before going into Gods house
Learn to speak properly
always pronounce your ings
Never smoke on the street
dont be caught dead
in them shameful tight slacks
spare the butter
economise
and for Christs sake
at all times
watch your language
As a teenager
she was like any other
boys the craic
smoking down the backs
Later there was talk
she broke things
furniture and glass
her mothers heart
Mad at the world
the old women nod
round each others faces
But it was more
than that
and for less
she was punished
That weekend
she didnt leave a cup alone
every chair hit the wall
Philomenas revenge
Soon after
she was shifted
and given the shocks
Round each others faces
the old women nod
Treatment treatment
theyve given her the treatment
These days
she gets on with the furniture
wears someone elses walk
sees visions in glass
Shes good too
for getting the messages
small things bread and milk
sometimes the paper
and closing the gate
after her father drives out
she waits for his signal
he always shouts twice
Get the gate Philo
get the gate girl
                                                           June 5 1892
Dear Daughter
                             Can you be fiftythree this
month I still look for you to peek around
my door as if youd discovered a toy
you thought gone for good ready at my smile
to run up and press your fist into my
broken palm But your own girls have outgrown
such games and I cannot pilfer back time
I spent pursuing Freedom Fair to you
to your brothers your mother Hardly
                                                                       But
what other choice did I have What sham
what shabby love could I offer you so
long as Thomas Auld held the law over
my head And when the personal threat was
ended whose eyes could mine enter without
shame if turning toward my wife and children
meant turning my back
                                               Your mothers eyes stare
out at me through yours of late You think I
didnt love her that my quick remarriage
makes a Gertrude of me a corseted
Hamlet of you Youre as wrong as you are
lucky Had Anna Murray had your
education as a girl my love for
her would have been as passionate as it
was grateful But she died illiterate
when I had risked my life to master language
The pleasures of book and pen retain
the thrill of danger even now and you
may understand why Ottilie Assing
come into our house to translate me into
German could command so many hours
years of my timeor as you would likely
say of your mothers time
                                                Forgive me
Rosetta for broaching such indelicate
subjects but as my eldest child and
only living daughter I want you to
feel certain that Helen became the new
Mrs Douglass because of what we shared
in sheaves of my papers let no one
persuade you I coveted her skin
I am not proud of how I husbanded
your mother all those years but marriage
too is a peculiar institution
I could not have stayed so unequally yoked
so long without a kind of Freedom in
it Anna accepted this and I dont
have to tell you that her lot was better
and she happier than if shed squatted
with some other man in a mutual
ignorance
                 Perhaps I will post rather
than burn this letter this time Ive written it
so often right down to these closing lines
in which I beg you to be kinder much
kinder to your stepmother You two are
of an age to be sisters and of like
temperamentunder other circumstances
you might have found Friendship in each other
With regards to your husbandI am as
ever your loving father

i want her tin skin i want
       her militant barbie breast
resistant cupped no cocked
       in the V of her elbow i want
my curves mountainous
and locked i want her
       arabesque eyes i want her
tar markings her curlicues
       i want her tin skin she
is a tree her hair a forest
of strength i want to be
       adorned with bottles i
want my brownness
       to cover all but the silver
edges of my tin skin my
sculptor should have made
       me like her roundbellied
maker hewed her with chain
       saw in hand roughly cut
away from me everything
but the semblance of tender
       let nothing but my flexed
foot toeing childhood tell
     the nighteyed who know
how to look what lies within

hes as high as a georgia pine my fatherd say half laughing southern trees
as measure metaphor highways lined with kudzucovered southern trees
fuchsia lavender white light pink purple  crape myrtle bouquets burst
open on sturdy branches of skinsmooth bark  my favorite southern trees
  one hundred degrees in the shade  we settle into still pools of humidity moss
dark beneath live oaks southern heat makes us grateful for southern trees
the maples in our front yard flew in spring on helicopter wings in fall we
splashed in colored leaves but never sought sap from these southern trees
  frankly my dear thats a magnolia i tell her fingering the deep green nearly
plastic leaves amazed how little a northern girl knows about southern trees
ive never forgotten the charred bitter fruit of holidays poplars nor will i 
its part of what makes me evie   i grew up in the shadow of southern trees
       we make midnight a maquette of the year
frostlight glinting off snow to solemnize
       the vows we offer to ourselves in near
silence the competition shimmerwise
       of champagne and chandeliers to attract
laughter and cheers the glow from the fireplace
       reflecting the burning intrared pact
between beloveds we cosset the space
       of a fey hour anxious gods molding our
hopedfor adams with this temporal clay
       each of us edacious for shining or
rash enough to think sacrifice will stay
       this fugacious time while stillness suspends
vitality in balance as passions
       struggle with passions for sway the mind wends
towards whats to come a callithump of fashions
       ersatz smiles crowded days a bloodless cut
that severs soul from bone a long aching
       quiet in which we will hear nothing but
the clean crack of our promises breaking
We are the knife people iron men coat people
       and helandssailing
Souse eaters house makers husbands
       of kine and goat and swine farm builders
       and keepers of kettle and scummer word
       scratchers corn stealers and bad sleepers
As if towns could build themselves
As if stumps jumped from the ground or
       flesh of beasts fell into trenchers
As if paradise prevailed on earth
To come to rich moulds and lush plantings
       longnecked trees and tongues of land
to redd the wild for the unborn
       To reck not the peril
Suffering snakes that may fly wolves
       that may ravish Kingdom
       of sachem and sagamore
Kingdom of corn and thorny promise
To satisfy our appetite of spirit
       our thirst of property
To seek not the opera of war but
       belittled by the possibilities
to stand silenced by the task before us
these be my sudden and undigested thoughts
In the spring time the stars began looking for him
By summer time they had found him
By autumn time they had wounded him
       so that the orange and red of his blood began
       to leak from the sky onto the leaves of the trees
By winter time they had slain him
       so that his white fat began to melt and drip
       falling as snow all over the land
And then he would begin to rise again
       first as sap in the trees
       stretching higher and higher
until his back ached but
       knowing he would not stop until
       his black fur was hidden
       deep among the unborn
behind the dark wall of the night sky
Once in moonlight when I had not slept for three nights
when there was no food and a long rain had stopped
and some had slept outside in the rain you could see
the streaks it had left on their skin
once in the eighth week of my captivity
alone in the moonlight outside on the ledge
I looked up and felt the stars move
strangely back and forth a slow rocking
as though the Lord were rocking us somehow back and forth
and I was not afraid but tears came anyway
as I remembered my children so far away
the way children can call you back
in through your thoughts and keep you awake
like hearing the stars ring all night long
And when you watch animals die
when deer die you notice it
how they dont cry out
I could see it in my minds eye
they dont cry out but lie there eyes open
and then they are dead outside of themselves
they are dead but inside themselves
they have joined the earth where they have always been
rocking and rockingAnd so
I was able to sleep a few hours before our next remove
miles and miles beyond the Great River
though I had lost track of our place in the world
Stronger than alcohol more great than song
deep in whose reeds great elephants decay
I an island sail and my shoes toss
on a fragrant evening fraught with sadness
bristling hate
Its true I weep too much Dawns break
slow kisses on the eyelids of the sea
what other men sometimes have thought theyve seen
And since then Ive been bathing in the poem
lifting her shadowy flowers up for me
and hurled by hurricanes to a birdless place
the waving flags nor pass by prison ships
O let me burst and I be lost at sea
and fall on my knees then womanly
banging around in a cigarette      she isnt in love
my dream a drink with Ira Hayes we discuss the code of the west
my hands make love to my body when my arms are around you
you never tell me your name
and I am forced to write belly when I mean love
Au revoir scene
I waken read write long letters and
wander restlessly when leaves are blowing
my dream a crumpled horn
in advance of the broken arm
she murmurs of signs to her fingers
weeps in the morning to waken so shackled with love
Not me I like to beat people up
My dream a white tree
I like to beat people up
absence of passion principles love She murmurs
What just popped into my eye was a fiends umbrella
and if you should come and pinch me now
as I go out for coffee
   as I was saying winter of 18 lumps
Days produce life locations to banish 7 up
Nomads my babies where are you Lifes
My dream which is gunfire in my poem
Orange cavities of dreams stir inside The Poems
Whatever is going to happen is already happening
Some people prefer the interior monologue
I like to beat people up
His piercing pincenez Some dim frieze
Hands point to a dim frieze in the dark night
In the book of his music the corners have straightened
Which owe their presence to our sleeping hands
The oxblood from the hands which play
For fire for warmth for hands for growth
Is there room in the room that you room in
Upon his structured tomb
Still they mean something For the dance
And the architecture
Weave among incidents
May be portentous to him
We are the sleeping fragments of his sky
Wind giving presence to fragments
after Gwendolyn Brooks
I 1981
When I am so small Das sock covers my arm we
cruise at twilight until we find the place the real
men lean bloodshot and translucent with cool
His smile is a goldplated incantation as we
drift by women on bar stools with nothing left
in them but approachlessness This is a school
I do not know yet But the cue sticks mean we
are rubbed by light smooth as wood the lurk
of smoke thinned to song We wont be out late
Standing in the middle of the street last night we
watched the moonlit lawns and a neighbor strike
his son in the face A shadow knocked straight
Da promised to leave me everything the shovel we
used to bury the dog the words he loved to sing
his rusted pistol his squeaky Bible his sin
The boys sneakers were light on the road We
watched him run to us looking wounded and thin
Hed been caught lying or drinking his fathers gin
Hed been defending his ma trying to be a man We
stood in the road and my father talked about jazz
how sometimes a tune is born of outrage By June
the boy would be locked upstate That night we
got down on our knees in my room If I should die before I wake Da said to me it will be too soon
II 1991
Into the tented city we go we
akened by the fires ethereal
afterglow Born lost and cool
er than heartache What we
know is what we know The left
hand severed and school
ed by cleverness A plate of we
ekdays cooking The hour lurk
ing in the afterglow A late
night chant Into the city we
go Close your eyes and strike
a blow Light can be straight
ened by its shadow What we
break is what we hold A sing
ular blue note An outcry sin
ged exiting the throat We
push until we thin thin
king we wont creep back again
While God licks his kin we
sing until our blood is jazz
we swing from June to June
We sweat to keep from we
eping Groomed on a die
t of hunger we end too soon
My son and I walk away from his sisters dayold grave Our backs to the sun the forward pitch of our shadows tells us the time By sweetest accident he inclines his shadow touching mine
I was sent home the first daywith a note Danny needs a rulerMy father nodded nothing seemed so aptSchool is for rules countries need rulersgraphs need graphing the world is straight aheadIt had metrics one side inches the otherYou could see where it startedand why it stopped a foot alonghow it ruled the flighty penwhich petered out sideways when you dreamtI could have learned a lotunderstood latitude or the border with Canadaso stern compared to the Southand its unruly river with two namesBut that first day meandering home I dropped it
    How perfectly he has mastered the car alarm jangling us from sleep    Later his staccato scatters smaller birds that landed on the wire beside him    Perhaps the key to success is imitation not originality    Once when the cat slinked up the orange tree and snatched a hatchling    the mockingbird turned on us marked us for revenge    For two whole weeks he dive bombed whenever I ventured out the screen door    lured by his call first tricked into thinking the soft coo was a mourning dove courting    next drawn by the war cry of a far larger animal He swooped from one splintered eave his mate from the other    aiming to peck out my eyes to wrestlethe baby from my arms to do God knows what    with that newborn
The eagle floats and glidescircling the burnished aspenthen takes the high pineswith a flash of underwingAs surely as the eagle sailstoward the bays open curveas surely as he swoops and seizesthe struggling fish pullingit from an ospreys beakso too autumn descendsto steal the glisteningsummer from our open hands
But prayer was not enough after all for my father His last two brothers died five weeks apart He couldnt get to sleep had no appetite sat staring Though he prayedhe could find no peace until he tried to write about his brothers tell a story for each one Perrys long travail with the steamfitters union which he worked for and Harveyhere the handwriting changes he bears downHarvey loved his childrenI discovered those few sheets of paper as I looked through my fathers old Bible on the morning of his funeral The others in the family had seen them long ago they had all known the story and they told me I had not most probably because I am a writer and my father was embarrassed by his effort Yet who has seen him as I can risenin the middle of the night bending over the paper working close to the heart of all greatness he is so lost
Leaving again If I didnt care I wouldnt be grieving The particulars of place lodged in me like this room I lived in for eleven days how I learned the way the sun laid its palm over the side window in the morning heavy light how Ill never be held in that hand again

she steals the scenery easily
with her laughter and turn
pitching hoof and tail
in mockery    indispensable humor
she takes this morning
under gray the shade of nickel
to cloud the stress enabling
me to speak to you of
beauty
First
there was some other order of things
never spoken
but in dreams of darkest creation
Then there was black earth
lake the face of light on water
Then the thick forest all around
that light
and then the human clay
whose blood we still carry
rose up in us
who remember caves with red bison
painted in their own blood
after their kind
A wildness
swam inside our mothers
desire through closed eyes
a new child
wearing the red wet mask of birth
delivered into this land
already wounded
stolen and burned
beyond reckoning
Red is this yielding land
turned inside out
by a country of hunters
with iron flint and fire
Red is the fear
that turns a knife back
against men holds it at their throats
and they cannot see the claw on the handle
the animal hand
that haunts them
from some place inside their blood
So that is hunting birth
and one kind of death
Then there was medicine the healing of wounds
Red was the infinite fruit
of stolen bodies
The doctors wanted to know
what invented disease
how wounds healed
from inside themselves
how life stands up in skin
if not by magic
They divined the red shadows of leeches
that swam in white bowls of water
they believed stars
in the cup of sky
They cut the wall of skin
to let
what was bad escape
but they were reading the story of fire
gone out
and that was a science
As for the animal hand on deaths knife
knives have as many sides
as the red father of war
who signs his name
in the blood of other men
And red was the soldier
who crawled
through a ditch
of human blood in order to live
It was the canal of his deliverance
It is his son who lives near me
Red is the thunder in our ears
when we meet
Love like creation
is some other order of things
Red is the share of fire
I have stolen
from root hoof fallen fruit
And this was hunger
Red is the human house
I come back to at night
swimming inside the cave of skin
that remembers bison
In that round nation
of blood
we are all burning
red inseparable fires
the living have crawled
and climbed through
in order to live
so nothing will be left
for death at the end
This life in the fire I love it
I want it
this life
I was birthed restless and elsewhere
gut dragging and bulging with ball lightning slush
broke through with branches steel
I was bitchmonikered hipped I hefted
a whip rain a swirling sheet of grit
Scraping toward the first of you hungering for wood walls
unturned skin With shifting and frantic mouth I loudly loved
the slow bones
of elders fools and willows
for Quincy T Trouppe Sr 
father it was an honor to be there in the dugout
with you the glory of great black men swinging their lives
as bats at tiny white balls
burning in at unbelievable speeds riding up  in  out
a curve breaking down wicked like a ball falling off a table
moving away snaking down screwing its stitched magic
into chitlin circuit air its comma seams spinning
toward breakdown dipping like a hipster
bebopping a kneedip stride in the charlie parker forties
wrist curling like a swans neck
behind a slick black back
cupping an invisible ball of dreams
 you there father regal as an african obeah man
sculpted out of wood from a sacred tree of no name no place origin
thick branches branching down into cherokee  someplace else lost
way back in africa the sap running dry
crossing from north carolina into georgia inside grandmother marys
womb where your mother had you in the violence of that red soil
ink blotter news gone now into blood graves
of american blues sponging rococo
truth long gone as dinosaurs
the agentoranged landscape of former names
absent of african polysyllables dry husk consonants there
now in their place names flat as polluted rivers
 that guitar string smile always snaking across
some virulent american rednecks face
scorching like atomic heat mushrooming over nagasaki
 hiroshima the fever blistered shadows of it all
inked as etchings into sizzled concrete
but you there father through it all a yardbird solo
riffing on bat  ball glory breaking down the fabricated myths
of white major league legends of who was better than who
beating them at their own crap
game with killer bats as bud powell swung his silence into beauty
of a josh gibson home run skittering across piano keys of bleachers
shattering all manufactured legends up there in lights
struck out white knights on the risky edge of amazement
awe the miraculous truth sluicing through
steeped  disguised in the blues
confluencing like the point at the cross
when a fastball hides itself up in a slider curve
breaking down  away in a wicked sly grin
curved  posed as an assscratching uncle tom who
like old sachel paige delivering his famed hesitation pitch
before coming back with a hard high fast one is slicker
sliding  quicker than a professional hitman
the deadliness of it all the sudden strike
like that of the brown bombers crossing right
of sugar ray robinsons lightning cobra bite
 you there father through it all catching rhythms
of chono pozo balls drumming like conga beats into your catchers mitt
hard  fast as cool papa bell jumping into bed
before the lights went out
of the old negro baseball league a promise you were
father a harbinger of shock waves soon come

Lets watch
In this part of Mexico
Se habla inglish
The mountain have changed to buildings
Is this hallway the inside of a stem
That has a rattling flower for a head
Immense tree bark with roots made out of
Mailboxes
In the vertical village moons fly out of
Apartment windows and though what you
See is a modern city
The mountains guitars pluck inside
Its agriculture taking an elevator
Through urban caves which lead to
Paths underground They say Camuy
To Hutuado
Taino subground like the IRT in
Constant motion
The streets take walks in your dark eyes
Seashell necklaces make music in the
Origin of silence
What are we stepping on Pineapple
Fields frozen with snow
Concrete dirt later the rocks of the
Atlantic
The sculpture of the inner earth
Down there where you thought only worms
And unnamed crocodiles parade
Lefty stands on a corner
Analyzing every seed
Squeezing the walls as he passes
Through at the bottom of the basement
Where the boiler makes heat
The flesh arrives out of a hole
In the mountain that goes up like a
Green wall
Bodies come in making maraca sounds
An invisible map out of the flora
Bees arrive in the vicinity and sing
Chorus while woody woodpeckers make
Women out of trees and place flowers
On their heads
Waterfalls like Hurakans faucets
Caress the back of Yuquiyu
God to all whose tongues have the
Arawaks echoes
Hallway of graffiti like the master
Cave drawings made by owls when they
Had hands
You see the fish with pyramids inside
Their stomachs
Hanging near the doorways where
San Lazaro turns the keys
Villa Manhattan
Breeze of saint juice made from
Coconuts
Slide down the stairs to your
Belly and like a hypnotized guanabana
You float down the street
And win all your hands at dominoes
The Moros live on the top floor eating
Roots and have a rooster on the roof
Africans import okra from the bodega
The Indians make a base of guava
On the first floor
The building is spinning itself into
a spiral of salsa
Heaven must be calling or the
Residents know the direction
Because there is an upward pull
If you rise too quickly from your seat
You might have to comb a spirits
Hair
They float over the chimneys
Arrive through the smog
Appear through the plaster of Paris
It is the same people in the windowed
Mountains
Her voice comes out of her knees
her fingernails are full of sound
Birds are in her lungs
which gives her gargantuan flight
A florescence through ether waves
like ancestral Morse codes
Oriente province de Cuba
her first steps
At nineteen she dismantled retinas
roosters blew themselves inside out
When she swayed by cathedrals they folded
guayacan trees fell to their knees
Mountains bowed with the contents
for ajiaco
She filled the horizon with kerchiefs
gypsies danced behind her
Her bracelets were snakes
forces were captured in her gold chains
The moon was in her silver
there were reptiles stationed
In her AfroSiboney cheeks
there were in her Asian eyes
Radars picking up the fingertips
of the piano player
The language of the trumpet
black changos landing upon
The shelf of her eyelids
She motioned in songs to live them
Her passion destroyed the container
She blew up into false promises
romantic lyrics tied her in knots
Broken into pieces of kisses
she knew it was theater
That you offered
A landscape hanging in the
museums of desire
Rows of guayava paste
stories that according
To your point of view
salons of dried roses
Illusions
Her songs became the windows
of the city
In the distance a hurt bellows
from a bird locked in a radio
Classroom teacher of tropical children
reading to them native flora
A wind entered her and she flew to
New York
eating the skyline
Bridges of electric lights
conduits to the house of the Saints
At the Jefferson Theater
she melted the microphone
Into liquid mercury
and an ambulance had to
Get her off the stage
She embodied in gowns capes
dresses necklaces bonnets
Velvets suedes diamondstudded
flowers sequins
All through which
she wanted to eat herself
She salvaged us all
but took the radiation
Each time she sang
she crossed the sea
From the Bronx
she went back to Cuba
Adrift on the sails
of a song
a rooftop has an enemy
an owl
a cone of confusion
scansion of acoustics
or before sound
a crematorium
visually unresolved
before           remains
leaves that only look
like the birds
between them
physiology limits
visual memory
ash or     bodies
in glass
how this time is a fact of shared space
looking to pass through undifferentiated
memory always has a back door
            no one word settles
            me
or rather than resist
rather than resolution
such that lists
fall from
one

the termites had deboned the thing
it was clean there was no saving it
in one bedroom a dresser with blue drawers
its peglegs rested on pure membrane
a girl just stood in her underwear
ran the tips of her fingers over her ribs
thought greyhound no one knew no explaining
why she didnt fall through the floor
the kids were drinking beer in the yard
the tetherball rope caught one girls throat
her mothers face obscured
behind the porch screen the mesquite shadow
no one could make her out
her feet rested on hot sashes of dust
the sounds on the television were far away
as that big caliche mound looked lake a waving man
the president got shot
the boards stayed together for another three days
it was a matter of apathy or swelling
or everyone was too hot to move
the live oak over the nursery got a disease
they could only save one limb
it wasnt surprising it wasnt that kind of nursery
a girl rode her red tricycle around the bottom of the pool
the pool had no water it hadnt rained
the girl kept smelling her hand
it smelled like honeywheat or the inside of a girls panties
someone said race you
she nodded okay and pedaled like hell
after three laps no one had passed her
she looked over her shoulder lost her balance
ripped her hands  knees on the blue concrete
the one limb on the live oak curved like a question
would she need stitches again
there was already ink under her skin  iodine on her tongue
or was it the other way around
she could see black thread bunching
sewing centipedes under her skin
her throat burned and she couldnt move her legs
it wasnt a tricycle
it was something she couldnt get her foot out from under
she hated to stop or lose her shoe and Im sorry
the pool was full of water
Its no wonder          Im always tired          with all these tract houses
                                    Its night  cold
on my belly in                                                  the undeveloped field now
                                    I have to bury her
clothing inside                                                a black garbage bag in plot D
police cars roll         past but continue        down the treeless parkway
                                    even after shining       
their lights on                                                  me in my freshman sundress
                                    I can only assume
they dont see                                                  the significance of my presence
but I must say          1994 is a simpler         timenot everyone is suspect
                                    I crawl up next to
my old house                                                    look through a lit window
                                    my mother reads
a book in bed            I want to knock           on the glass theres something
                                    I need to tell her
If youre loves lover and look for love
cold smoke the dog called bashfulness
beware for your conversation is a hindrancy
this poem isnt interested Ill bill you
Whyd the mad one make madness in a thousand works
that wild one make a thousand wild works of wiles
now he disrobes now hes so fast
now he likes intoxicating substances and wants to die
Since a spider spies and eats a whole deer
behold what the web of Zoroastrianism will do
Since the love of nighties had positive market outlook
how will it be with He took His servant in nighties
Have you not seen the book of Waisa and Ramin
Have you not heard the tales of Wamiq and Adra
You hike your denim so you dont wear water
do you have to pull that bridge stunt over  over
The way of love is filth and Im drunk
the storm stormshow should a storm calm
youll be the jewel in the ring of lovers
If youre insistent on assuming the consequence of jewelry
so say it how does the earth hurt if we fuck
what gifts would be unreasonable
its not cool to beat a drum when yr in bed son
and put your erection in the middle of the desert
Listen to the sounds of fucking and coming
under the sky which Orientals perhaps owing
to some optical peculiarity see as green
When youre drunk take your clothes off
Heaven is great Orion is confused
how the world is high and killed
by love which is high and killed
When the sun comes out where do nighties hide
When the come comes where does the pent go
Im done Speak to me souls souls soul
From desire of whom from whose desire every throat was cut
Someone said you were dead
its not that I didnt care
You were not bacterial
You were not frozen water in winter
You were not a hairbrush broken by hair
You were a treasure of gold in the worldtoilet
For you appraised the world of grains
And flung the earth to the earth
The good wine is mixed with the bad wine
come to the wine jars lips and lets unmix it
Poor people only have one soul
but you and I have two
lets go on vacation to Mexico or Rome
Everybody returns home
How should old people associate with young people
Shut upBe like a compass The King
has erased your name from the book of speech
    This boat youre videotaping Youre looking at a boat Despite your protests that you are looking at a translation of the fourth poem in the corpus of Catullus I assure you you are looking at this boat Lots of bad things battered this boat Forget about volunteering to swab its lintels This boat denies it was minced in the Adriatic It denies that it lit up the Cyclades with an all night buck and spill Rhodes is horrible noble Thracian Proponents of Rhodes call truce though it might be their sinuses Where this boat is is postboat The word for this boat is phaselus A phaselus was a rather long and narrow vessel named for its resemblance to a kidney bean This boat was built for speed Yet this boat is sort of fragile Lots of bad things battered this boat from the beginning of its life to now You state its cracked but I tell you to go put your stupid hands in the water Say it again The boat frets about its impotence falls over dead The boat sucks lava dexterously yes this boat is righthanded Its aura chainsmokes cigarettes looks up at Jupiter out there in space and its beams moist What happens below deck and involves feet stays below deck Im not literally pointing out this boat to you Im writing a poem about it in limping trimeters But this is a fact botulism is sad Noobs lurch toward a limpid coast And before them stands a boat a beautiful old boat looking like a kidney bean built for speed It sits there quiet and old looking over the lake and thinking this lake is really limpid The noobs all have twins

I have so little want of activity
even writing with its pain more terrible than life
I dont want but do because Im kind of stupid finally
not in the way you Sarah know I am
nor you reader who think of me fishing
Line spindle lure bait Instruments for me
are accessories even the matchbook is only
a tiara to my eyes the fishing lure a long
 white bracelet Some of my
socalled friends think of me as a derelict
they always try to hold me to account
Tell me what happened on the drunken night in question
On the witness stand I am a kitten
terribly cute but I cant say a thing
about stupid or fish or last night
I like to lay at the base of a hill
asleep while the shepherds work
bringing things to heel with tepid will where I source
my contempt in the index of swill
The entries there make no mention of hell
which was sifted through the vale of tears  fell
to make Earth  the base of this hill where I sunbathe  murmur
jealous cellmate as my willful peers go by
for Andrew Joron
the desire to show is destruction
in lessons forgot before learned
no shrunken heads hang by wires
no mourning songs of halfremembered
shutters open the width of an eyelash
it is enough for vision to run
its finger along for access to steal
from forbidden shores the stillcold
beams of night and pack them in ice
but a child couldnt live here nonetheless
in the morning is come a bell that summons
a fortune that reads she will sooncross the water and the intended instructions
which may not florish after all
she leaves a painting outside her room
and in the morning its gone
and not one word is spoke between them
but her father carries it to his grave
the desire to show is destruction
and we are not hung with skins
we must follow internal echoes
commit ourselves to memory
the trapdoor is closed am finite again but a moment agolevitation
purple lights the bluewater bridge turned on the oil
black river st clair became fuel for the nightfishers there
it was the dream of a memory or the memory of a dream
that dumped me below a window watching a woman change
into a man she entered his dairy log at first all the world was americaand didnt that suck he thunk and strunk his cunk against
an overwrought iron fence they stood waiting like that photograph
of the bootblack jack and the aristocrat
                                                       looking away from her window
at a fact well worth recordingAlexander Graham Bell wanted to call
his daughter Photophone between the forest and the gander
i hand her over to Metacomet yes i certainly did
and King Philip sayeth unto me nature denatured thee
friction alone makes her come therefore i need some more
before you make me wearum pants O failed invention
whered you get that voice refusing to come
to a particular point castration finally made sense
the madder runs
like blood
lifeblood of
the livebud
that kindles next to earth
the hair on the church is water
the lovebirds curve their crutches down
so long
to the sacred
palaces
so long to the fingerbone that lingers on
if im alive
its no thanks to you
if im comatose
lets make the most of it
tomato ghost
rude twilight
ruby tear
discipline disappears
between the shapeless necklace
and the cloudy robe of shrapnel
in the absence
of incense
no balm can grease
the throbbing temples
of the rotting world
This sonnet is your personal amulet
To be worn in instance of need
Or constantly held in the mind
Occurring here and elsewhere at this moment
This sonnet is sent without cunning
To cull a particular phrase from your lips
To enlist another protector
In this age of malcontent benefactors
Against an ironclad schooner
Feudal kingdom
Dismemberment by jubilant crowds
Strangely indifferent faces
Heat and dust besides
Suicide implicating others
dreaming the lives of the ancestors
you awake justly terrified of this worldyou could dance underwater and not get wet
you hear but the pressure is drowning you 
youre awake but just terrified of this world
where all solids are ice underwater boogie
you hear but the press sure is drowning you
the igbo were walking not dancing
where all solids are ice underwater boogie
is good advice because theyre quick to melt
the igbo were straight up walking not dancing
and youve still got to get through this life
take my advice quickly theyre meltingyou could dance underwater and not get wet
and youve got to to get through this life still
dreaming the lives of the ancestors
To fight aloud is very brave  
But gallanter I know
Who charge within the bosom
The Calvalry of Wo  
Who win and nations do not see  
Who fall  and none observe  
Whose dying eyes no Country
Regards with patriot love  
We trust in plumed procession
For such the Angels go 
Rank after Rank with even feet 
And Uniforms of snow
We are coming Father Abraham three hundred thousand more  From Mississippis winding stream and from New Englands shore  We leave our ploughs and workshops our wives and children dear  With hearts too full for utterance with but a silent tear  We dare not look behind us but steadfastly before  We are coming Father Abraham three hundred thousand more   If you look across the hill tops that meet the Northern sky  Long moving lines of rising dust your vision may descry  And now the wind an instant tears the cloudy vail aside  And floats aloft our spangled flag in glory and in pride  And bayonets in the sunlight gleam and bands brave music pour  We are coming Father Abraham three hundred thousand more   If you look all up your valleys where the growing harvests shine  You may see our sturdy farmer boys fast forming into line  And children from their mothers knees are pulling at the weeds  And learning how to reap and sow against their countrys needs  And a farewell group stands weeping at every cottage door  We are coming Father Abraham three hundred thousand more   You have called us and were coming by Richmonds bloody tide  To lay us down for freedoms sake our brothers bones beside  Or from foul treasons savage group to wrench the murderous blade  And in the face of foreign foes its fragments to parade  Six hundred thousand loyal men and true have gone before  We are coming Father Abraham three hundred thousand more
Weep for the country in its present stateAnd of the gloom which still the future waitsThe proud confederate eagle heard the soundAnd with her flight fell prostrate to the groundWeep for the loss the country has sustainedBy which her now dependent is in jailThe grief of him who now the war survivedThe conscript husbands and the weeping wivesWeep for the seas of blood the battle costAnd souls that ever hope forever lostThe ravage of the field with no recruitTrees by the vengeance blasted to the rootWeep for the downfall oer your heads and chiefWho sunk without a medium of reliefWho fell beneath the hatchet of their prideThen like the serpent bit themselves and diedWeep for the downfall of your presidentWho far too late his folly must repentWho like the dragon did all heaven assailAnd dragged his friends to limbo with his tailWeep oer peculiar swelling coffers voidOur treasures left and all their banks destroyedTheir foundless notes replete with shame to allExpecting every day their final fallIn quest of profit never to be wonThen sadly fallen and forever down
            you put this pen
in my hand and you
take the pen from
            my hand the night
before the full moon
            the moon seems
full what is missing
is a dark hungry
            sickle the sliver

laughter lighting
the horizon with citrus
            rust and blood you
put this knife in my
            hand we pull we
meet as oceans come
together heaving
            against and clinging
across our salt watery
            boundary we approach
endlessly like two rails
of one track tied
            in a parallel that
promises our eyes to
            merge someplace far
off in the distance you
put this feather in my
            palm my fingers
close around flight
wedged in the top branches rain still sighing
            to earth as a dissolute sky dissolves
a mozambican woman turns mother

licking the trunk below a countrysized
            puddle calls forth the child whose name the mother
vowed would not be drowned no matter how

washed her bare yellow bathroom tile many
            years ago a diluvial warning
of my struggle to arrive we fought to
            get me out and have been tugging at each
other ever since tethered by a cord
            that simply thickens when its cut we
descended then thirsting churning not into

fear must have shuddered
into boston on the backs
of true believersmen and
women of an unadorned god
deep in the heavy black fabric
of their coats and dresses like
a stench black a mark of
pride they wore as if branded
never dreaming they could
take it off envy anticipated
their advent glittered at them
settling in from the knife
blades of the massachusetts
seeped like lowpitched
humming from the fur
lining the natives warm
blankets but desire docked
in 1638 in from the harbor
flocked a people whose eyes
sparked like stars even near
death whose hair promised
a mixture of cotton and river
water and vines a texture
the fingers ached for who
wholly inhabited a skin the
midnight color of grace
that clarified the hue of the
pilgrims woolen weeds fear
and envy claimed pride of place
put desires cargo to good use

so make moan of the old days

That which installs itself in the mind embraces sound
Rebounding
                         rounding the fecund earth
Birth as in what is not as in one makes one
                                                     is a mighty absence to understand
and there are those who fail to get their lessons done
Dun is the color of submission
Unfledged she leafs through what has been nothing never
Never to be what she is or could or hope to be
Bewitched by dictions fictions on the surface
Face naming that which she must save polished like an apple
Apple of the eye amour of town and street apple of the cheek
Eaten with a dab of honey for a sweet year
Ear to who am I in the suddenlyarriving whatcomesnext
Next to being next to delivery next to undergone
Gone parenthetical but now revived as her eye
Spies the sudden trespass of his unexpected welcome
Succumbing coming unto him in full sun this morning
Mourning what she need not beguile or lie beside
   some days ago I saw the picture of an Angel who in making the Annunciation seemed to be trying to chase Mary out of her room with movements showing the sort of attack one might make on some hated enemy and Mary as if desperate seemed to be trying to throw herself out of the window Do not fall into errors like these  
                                                                                                 Leonardo da Vinci
It is time to speak of the lies
            of images omissions insertions             imitations of reality                         but whose reality Leonardo 
     For you shes in nature 
                 youve lavished so much attention
                                      on rock formations along your raised horizon
                 varieties of grass in the lawn
                 cloud convocations 
                          and the shadow the archangel casts
            obliterating most of whats imagined growing there 
                        and she lovely composedgreat grace of shadows and of lights is added
to the faces of those who sit beside the darkness of brown plasterworkher right arm
almost deformed too far forward 
                        reaching out at an impossible angle
                                                FOR WHAT
 Botticelli Campin van Eyckfor you
shes indoors all decked out in luscious silk and satin
surrounded by finerytiedback drapery carved benches
a rug or tiled floor loggias
and archways beyond her wildest ken
windows revealing hortus conclusi and winding paths
              slogging toward the sea
And what of all those blues and golds so rife with wealth
            in her life theres only red from madder juice
            and yellow from kaolin clay
                        and a linen shift all frayed
The truth also is a small opening high up on the wall
A floor thats hardpacked dirt
And beyond the room villagers working the fields
donkeys dragging threshing boards over newly harvested wheat
            AND EVERYWHERE INSIDE AND OUT WORLDMOTHETING DUST
                                         For all of you
this is an event reduced to a book she cannot read
a lily she does not smell
a lectern she never owned
She might as well comb her hair with a stiletto heel
Make of her body a cloud of white tulle
Carry a watering can and wear shapely wooden clogs
Fake glamour in a black bareback gown
Crouch on the ground flipping coins
Pop a pogo stick between her legs and levitate
                          SHE COULD BE ANYONE            ANYWHERE             ANYTIME
She could be sitting in her slip bored
bored to death the intercom
image appearing out of nowhere
announcing a stranger
            prima materia take a deep breath
            for divinity to enter the world
                        your mystery must be experienced
Her eyes will go wide not expecting this
Her ears have encountered only silence
            and the soft moan of a dove
                        OOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
The trees thin
The cumulus sky crackles ever so quietly
Somewhere a rainbow breaks
            too loud now
                        too strident
                        Hes gotten in
Hail comes in pellets
            heavy hitters
            She will be patient
            and hear him out
                        though what she really wants is to get back under the covers
                        that are damask but a lie
                                    roughhewn flax is what shed have
Or she could be blending a batch of myrrh
and roses to deodorize the foul
stench of the room that opens out
not on a vista of budding poplars
but on sewage
piles of it
come to rot at the side of the road
just there in front of her door
            where broken planks of wood lean
            and bleating sheep wait to be herded up the hill
But heres this guy breezing in
                             Titan El Greco paint his feet unplanted on the ground
                                         is he preparing for a quick getaway
                                                     or must he be higher on the picture plane
                             Tintoretto catches him in midflight a showoff he
                             Martini and Crivelli force him to his knees
The breeze may be the whisper of something
              she is in danger of losing
                             the breeze may be her destiny
or his feathers could begin to moult
                             transaction of feathers
                             light as a feather
                                                in the face of all that dust she cant escape
or she could cringe at wings
                                  voracious unfurled
trying to scoop her up knock her down
drown her in their soft pile
snuff out any NO she stashes in her mind
or the wind could whip his feathers
and blow the townsfolk quickly to her side
          Today she knows no one will arrive in time    
          Certainly not those people tending their gardens
                      as if anyone had topiary trees
                               as Rogier van der Weyden possibly Memling shows
                                                read fields of barley and wheat
                                                              and plows plenty of plows
In his eyes pools of light map no pollution only flame
In hers no flecks no threads mar the cobalt calm
            until his hail scumbles their surface
            What is she to make of it
Her lids lower
Chrysalises her eyes close on their private dusk
                        shes already seen her share of Roman crucifixions
            perhaps the future is there and her eyes seek the great above
                             where son and mother will be united
            perhaps she conjugates the months
                                              nine is real
                                  a number done on her
            perhaps she dabbles with using rue to end the thing
                                              SHES GOT A CHOICE AFTER ALL
For the child she will have boundless love
For posterity the memory of being
For her life no proper translation

Four weeks in quarreling and far from home we came to the loneliest place A western railroad town Remember I left you at the campsite with greasy pans and told our children not to follow me The dying light had made me desperate I broke into a hobbled run across tracks past warehouses with sunblanked windows to where a playground shone in a wooded clearing Then I was swinging out over treetops I saw myself never going back yet whatever breathed in the mute woods was not another life The sun sank I let the swing die my toes scuffed earth and I was rocked into remembrance of the girl who had dreamed the life I had Through night dark at the root I returned to it
Nights we could not sleep        summer insects singing in dry heat              shortcircuiting the nervesGrandma would light a lamp         at the center of our narrow room               whose clean conspiracy of lightwhispered to the tall blank walls        illuminating them suddenly              like the canvas of a dreamBetween the lamp and wall        her arthritic wrists grew pliant              as she molded and castimprobable animal shapes moving        on the wordless screen              A blackbird like a mynah not a crowA dark horses head that could but would not talk        An ashen rabbit her elusive self           triggered in snowthat a quivering touch like deaths        sent scampering into the wings              of that little theater of shadows     that eased us into dreams
Our shadows bring them from the shadows a yolkyellow one with a navy pattern like a Japanese woodblock print of fish scales A fat 18karat one splashed with gaudy purple and a patch of gray One with a gold heada body skimmilkwhite trailing ventral fins like halffolded fans of lace A poppyred faintly disheveled one and one compact all indigo in faint green water They wear comical whiskers and gather beneath us as we lean on the cement railingin indecisive lateDecember light and because we do not feed them they pass then they loop and circle back Loop and circle Loop Look you say beneath them Beneath them like a subplot or a motive is a school of uniformly dark ones smaller unadorned perhaps another species living in the shadow of the gold purple yellow indigo and white seeking the mired roots and dusky grasses unliveried the quieter beneath the quiet
It wasnt until we got the Christmas tree into the house and up on the stand that our daughter discovered a small birds nest tucked among its needled branchesAmazing that the nest had made it all the way from Nova Scotia on a truckmashed together with hundreds of other trees without being dislodged or crushed And now it made the tree feel wilder a balsam fir growing in our living room as though at any moment a bird might flutter through the house and return to the nestAnd yet because wed brought the tree indoors wed turned the nest into the first ornament So we wound the tree with strings of lights draped it with strands of red beadsand added the other ornaments then dropped two small brass bells into the nest like eggs containing music and hung a painted goldfinch from the branch above as if to keep them warm
Cards in each mailbox angel manger star and lamb as the rural carrier driving the snowy roads hears from her bundles the plaintive bleating of sheep the shuffle of sandals the clopping of camels At stop after stop she opens the little tin door and places deep in the shadows the shepherds and wise men the donkeys lank and weary the cow who chews and muses And from her Styrofoam cup white as a star and perched on the dashboard leading her ever into the distance there is a hint of hazelnut and then a touch of myrrh
  The night John Henry is born an ax
         of lightning splits the sky
  and a hammer of thunder pounds the earth
     and the eagles and panthers cry
     John Henryhe says to his Ma and Pa
         Get a gallon of barleycorn
     I want to start right like a heman child
         the night that I am born
  Says I want some ham hocks ribs and jowls
         a pot of cabbage and greens
     some hoecakes jam and buttermilk
         a platter of pork and beans
     John Henrys Mashe wrings her hands
         and his Pahe scratches his head
     John Henryhe curses in giraffetall words
         flops over and kicks down the bed
     Hes burning mad like a bear on fire
         so he tears to the riverside
 As he stoops to drink Old Man River gets scared
         and runs upstream to hide
     Some say he was born in GeorgiaO Lord
         Some say in Alabam
  But its writ on the rock at the Big Bend Tunnel
     Lousyana was my home So scram
                     King Oliver of New Orleans
         has kicked the bucket but he left behind
              old Satchmo with his redhot horn
                to syncopate the heart and mind
                  The honkytonks in Storyville
       have turned to ashes have turned to dust
                 but old Satchmo is still around
         like Uncle Sams IN GOD WE TRUST
               Where oh where is Bessie Smith
       with her heart as big as the blues of truth
           Where oh where is Mister Jelly Roll
           with his Cadillac and diamond tooth
              Where oh where is Papa Handy
  With his blue notes adragging from bar to bar
       Where oh where is bulletproof Leadbelly
          with his tall tales and 12string guitar
                                Old Hip Cats
              when you sang and played the blues
                    the night Satchmo was born
       did you know hypodermic needles in Rome
         couldnt hoodoo him away from his horn
          Wyatt Earps legend John Henrys too
              is a dare and a bet to old Satchmo
  when his groovy blues put headlines in the news
            from the Gold Coast to cold Moscow
                                 Old Satchmos
    gravelly voice and tapping foot and crazy notes
                             set my soul on fire
                                   If I climbed
           the seventyseven steps of the Seventh
  Heaven Satchmos high C would carry me higher
         Are you hip to this Harlem Are you hip
              On Judgment Day Gabriel will say
                       after he blows his horn
   Id be the greatest trumpeter in the Universe
          if old Satchmo had never been born
Is this the river East I heard Where the ferries tugs and sailboats stirred And the reaching wharves from the inner land Ourstretched like the harmless receiving hand   And the silvery tinge that sparkles aloud Like the brilliant white demons which a tide has towed From the rays of the morning sun Which it doth ceaselessly shine upon   But look at the depth of the drippling tide The dripples reripples like the locusts astride As the boat turns upon the silvery spread It leavesstrangea shadow dead   And the very charms from the reflective river And from the stacks of the floating boat There seemeth the quality neer to dissever Like the ruffles from the mystified smoke
By a peninsula the painter sat and Sketched the uneven valley groves The apostle gave alms to the Meek The volcano burst In fusive sulphur and hurled  Rocks and ore into the air Heavens sudden change at The drawing tempestuous Darkening shade of dense clouded hues The wanderer soon chose His spot of rest they bore the  Chosen hero upon their shoulders Whom they strangely admired as The beachtide summer of people desired
The motion of gathering loops of water Must either burst or remain in a moment The violet colors through the glass Throw up little swellings that appear And spatter as soon as another strikes And is born so pure are they of colored Hues that we feel the absent strength Of its power When they begin they gather Like sand on the beach each bubble Contains a complete eye of water
This year till late in April the snow fell thick and light Thy truceflag friendly Nature in clinging drifts of white Hung over field and city now everywhere is seen In place of that white quietness a sudden glow of green   The verdure climbs the Common beneath the leafless trees To where the glorious Stars and Stripes are floating on the breeze There suddenly as Spring awoke from Winters snowdraped gloom The PassionFlower of Seventysix is bursting into bloom   Dear is the time of roses when earth to joy is wed And gardenplot and meadow wear one generous flush of red But now in dearer beauty to her ancient colors true Blooms the old town of Boston in red and white and blue   Along the whole awakening North are those bright emblems spread A summer noon of patriotism is burning overhead No party badges flaunting now no word of clique or clan But Up for God and Union is the shout of every man   Oh peace is dear to Northern hearts our hardearned homes more dear But freedom is beyond the price of any earthly cheer And freedoms flag is sacred he who would work it harm Let him although a brother beware our strong right arm   A brother ah the sorrow the anguish of that word The fratricidal strife begun when will its end be heard Not this the boon that patriot hearts have prayed and waited for We loved them and we longed for peace but they would have it war   Yes war on this memorial day the day of Lexington A lightningthrill along the wires from heart to heart has run Brave men we gazed on yesterday today for us have bled Again is Massachusetts blood the first for Freedom shed   To warand with our brethren thenif only this can be Life hangs as nothing in the scale against dear Liberty Though hearts be torn asunder for Freedom we will fight Our blood may seal the victory but God will shield the Right
All quiet along the Potomac they say       Except now and then a stray picket Is shot as he walks on his beat to and fro       By a rifleman hid in the thicket Tis nothinga private or two now and then       Will not count in the news of the battle Not an officer lostonly one of the men       Moaning out all alone his deathrattle                                                  All quiet along the Potomac tonight       Where the soldiers lie peacefully dreaming Their tents in the rays of the clear autumn moon       Or the light of the watchfire are gleaming A tremulous sigh as the gentle nightwind       Through the forestleaves softly is creeping While stars up above with their glittering eyes       Keep guardfor the army is sleeping   Theres only the sound of the lone sentrys tread       As he tramps from the rock to the fountain And thinks of the two in the low trundlebed       Far away in the cot on the mountain His musket falls slackhis face dark and grim       Grows gentle with memories tender As he mutters a prayer for the children asleep       For their mothermay Heaven defend her   The moon seems to shine just as brightly as then       That night when the love yet unspoken Leaped up to his lipswhen lowmurmured vows       Were pledged to be ever unbroken Then drawing his sleeve roughly over his eyes       He dashes off tears that are welling And gathers his gun closer up to its place       As if to keep down the heartswelling   He passes the fountain the blasted pinetree       The footstep is lagging and weary Yet onward he goes through the broad belt of light       Toward the shade of the forest so dreary Hark was it the nightwind that rustled the leaves       Was it moonlight so suddenly flashing It looked life a rifleHa Mary goodby       And the lifeblood is ebbing and plashing   All quiet along the Potomac tonight       No sound save the rush of the river While soft falls the dew on the face of the dead       The pickets off duty forever
Falling leaves and falling men     When the snows of winter fall And the winds of winter blows     Will be woven Natures pall   Let us then forsake our dead     For the dead will surely wait While we rush upon the foe     Eager for the heros fate   Leaves will come upon the trees     Spring will show the happy race Mothers will give birth to sons     Loyal souls to fill our place   Wherefore should we rest and rush     Soldiers we must fight and save Freedom now and give our foes     All their country shoulda grave
All day she stands before her loom     The flying shuttles come and go By grassy fields and trees in bloom     She sees the winding river flow And fancys shuttle flieth wide And faster than the waters glide   Is she entangled in her dreams     Like that fairweaver of Shalott Who left her mystic mirrors gleams     To gaze on light Sir Lancelot Her heart a mirror sadly true Brings gloomier visions into view   I weave and weave the livelong day     The woof is strong the warp is good I weave to be my mothers stay     I weave to win my daily food But ever as I weave saith she The world of women haunteth me   The river glides along one thread     In natures mesh so beautiful The stars are woven in the red     Of sunrise and the raincloud dull Each seems a separate wonder wrought Each blends with some more wondrous thought   So at the loom of life we weave     Our separate shreds that varying fall Some strained some fair and passing leave     To God the gathering up of all In that full pattern wherein man Works blindly out the eternal plan   In his vast work for good or ill     The undone and the done he blends With whatsoever woof we fill     To our weak hands His might He lends And gives the threads beneath His eye The texture of eternity   Wind on by willow and by pine     Thou blue untroubled Merrimack Afar by sunnier streams than thine     My sisters toil with foreheads black And water with their blood this root Whereof we gather bounteous fruit   There be sad women sick and poor     And those who walk in garments soiled Their shame their sorrow I endure     By their defect my hope is foiled The blot they bear is on my name Who sins and I am not to blame   And how much of your wrong is mine     Dark women slaving at the South Of your stolen grapes I quaff the wine     The bread you starve for fills my mouth The beam unwinds but every thread With blood of strangled souls is red   If this be so we win and wear     A Nessusrobe of poisoned cloth Or weave them shrouds they may not wear     Fathers and brothers falling both On ghastly deathsown fields that lie Beneath the tearless Southern sky   Alas the weft has lost its white     It grows a hideous tapestry That pictures wars abhorrent sight     Unroll not web of destiny Be the dark volume left unread The tale untoldthe curse unsaid   So up and down before her loom     She paces on and to and fro Till sunset fills the dusty room     And makes the water redly glow As if the Merrimacks calm flood Were changed into a stream of blood   Too soon fulfilled and all too true     The words she murmured as she wrought But weary weaver not to you     Alone was wars stern message brought Woman it knelled from heart to heart Thy sisters keeper know thou art
Dark as the clouds of even Ranked in the western heaven Waiting the breath that lifts All the dread mass and drifts Tempest and falling brand Over a ruined land So still and orderly Arm to arm knee to knee Waiting the great event Stands the Black Regiment   Down the long dusky line Teeth gleam and eyeballs shine And the bright bayonet Bristling and firmly set Flashed with a purpose grand Long ere the sharp command Of the fierce rolling drum Told them their time had come Told them what work was sent For the Black Regiment   Now the flagsergeant cried Though death and hell betide Let the whole nation see If we are fit to be Free in this land or bound Down like the whining hound Bound with red stripes of pain In our old chains again Oh what a shout there went From the Black Regiment   Charge Trump and drum awoke Onward the bondmen broke Bayonet and sabrestroke Vainly opposed their rush Through the wild battles crush With but one thought aflush Driving their lords like chaff In the guns mouths they laugh Or at the slippery brands Leaping with open hands Down they tear man and horse Down in their awful course Tramping with bloody heel Over the crashing steel All their eyes forward bent Rushed the Black Regiment  Freedom their battlecry Freedom or leave to die Ah And they meant the word Not as with us tis heard Not a mere party shout They gave their spirits out Trusted the end to God And on the gory sod Rolled in triumphant blood  Glad to strike one free blow Whether for weal or woe Glad to breathe one free breath Though on the lips of death Prayingalas in vain That they might fall again So they could once more see That burst to liberty This was what freedom lent To this Black Regiment  Hundreds on hundreds fell But they are resting well Scourges and shackles strong Never shall do them wrong  Oh to the living few Soldiers be just and true Hail them as comrades tried Fight with them side by side Never in field or tent Scorn the Black Regiment
Mangled uncared for suffering thro the night     With heavenly patience the poor boy had lain Under the dreary shadows left and right     Groaned on the wounded stiffened out the slain       What faith sustained his lone       Brave heart to make no moan To send no cry from that bloodsprinkled sod Is a close mystery with him and God  But when the light came and the morning dew     Glittered around him like a golden lake And every dripping flower with deepened hue     Looked through its tears for very pitys sake       He moved his aching head       Upon his rugged bed And smiled as a blue violet virginmeek Laid her pure kiss upon his withered cheek  At once there circled in his waking heart     A thousand memories of distant home Of how those same blue violets would start     Along his native fields and some would roam       Down his dear humming brooks       To hide in secret nooks And shyly met in nodding circles swing Like gossips murmuring at belated Spring  And then he thought of the beloved hands     That with his own had plucked the modest flower The blueeyed maiden crowned with golden bands     Who ruled as sovereign of that sunny hour       She at whose soft command       He joined the mustering band She for whose sake he lay so firm and still Despite his pangs not questioned then her will  So lost in thought scarce conscious of the deed     Culling the violets here and there he crept Slowlyah slowlyfor his wound would bleed     And the sweet flowers themselves half smiled half wept       To be thus gathered in       By hands so pale and thin By fingers trembling as they neatly laid Stem upon stem and bound them in a braid  The strangest posy ever fashioned yet     Was clasped against the bosom of the lad As we the seekers for the wounded set     His form upon our shoulders bowed and sad       Though he but seemed to think       How violets nod and wink And as we cheered him for the path was wild He only looked upon his flowers and smiled
Brave comrade answer When you joined the war     What left you Wife and children wealth and friends     A storied home whose ancient rooftree bends     Above such thoughts as love tells oer and oer Had you no pang or struggle Yes I bore     Such pain on parting as at hells gate rends     The entering soul when from its grasp ascends     The last faint virtue which on earth it wore You loved your home your kindred children wife     You loathed yet plunged into wars bloody whirl     What urged you Duty Something more than life That which made Abraham bare the priestly knife     And Isaac kneel or that young Hebrew girl     Who sought her father coming from the strife
Oh slow to smite and swift to spare Gentle and merciful and just Who in the fear of God didst bear The sword of power a nations trust  In sorrow by thy bier we stand Amid the awe that hushes all And speak the anguish of a land That shook with horror at thy fall  Thy task is done the bond are free We bear thee to an honored grave Whose proudest monument shall be The broken fetters of the slave  Pure was thy life its bloody close Hath placed thee with the sons of light Among the noble host of those Who perished in the cause of Right
Today O martyred chief beneath the sun We would unveil thy form to thee who won Thapplause of nations for thy soul sincere A loving tribute we would offer here T was thine not worlds to conquer but mens hearts To change to balm the sting of slaverys darts In lowly charity thy joy to find And open gates of mercy on mankind And so they come the freed with grateful gift From whose sad path the shadows thou didst lift  Eleven years have rolled their seasons round Since its most tragic close thy lifework found Yet through the vistas of the vanished days We see thee still responsive to our gaze As ever to thy countrys solemn needs Not regal coronets but princely deeds Were thy chaste diadem of truer worth Thy modest virtues than the gems of earth Stanch honest fervent in the purest cause Truth was thy guide her mandates were thy laws  Rare heroism spiritpurity The storied Spartans stern simplicity Such moral strength as gleams like burnished gold Amid the doubt of men of weaker mould Were thine Called in thy countrys sorest hour When brother knew not brothermad for power To guide the helm through bloody deeps of war While distant nations gazed in anxious awe Unflinching in the task thou didst fulfill Thy mighty mission with a deathless will  Born to a destiny the most sublime Thou wert O Lincoln in the march of time God bade thee pause and bid the oppressed go free Most glorious boon givn to humanity While slavery ruled the land what deeds were done What tragedies enacted neath the sun Her page is blurred with records of defeat Of lives heroic lived in silence meet For the worlds praise of woe despair and tears The speechless agony of weary years  Thou utteredst the word and Freedom fair Rang her sweet bells on the clear winter air She waved her magic wand and lo from far A long procession came With many a scar Their brows were wrinkled in the bitter strife Full many had said their sad farewell to life But on they hastened free their shackles gone The aged youngeen infancy was borne To offer unto thee loud paeans of praise Their happy tribute after saddest days  A race set free The deed brought joy and light It bade calm Justice from her sacred height When faith and hope and courage slowly waned Unfurl the stars and stripes at last unstained The nations rolled acclaim from sea to sea And Heavens vault rang with Freedoms harmony The angels mid the amaranths must have hushed Their chanted cadences as upward rushed The hymn sublime and as the echoes pealed Gods ceaseless benison the action sealed  As now we dedicate this shaft to thee True champion in all humility And solemn earnestness we would erect A monument invisible undecked Save by our allied purpose to be true To Freedoms loftiest precepts so that through The fiercest contests we may walk secure Fixed on foundations that may still endure When granite shall have crumbled to decay And generations passed from earth away  Exalted patriot illustrious chief Thy lifes immortal work compels belief Today in radiance thy virtues shine And how can we a fitting garland twine Thy crown most glorious to a ransomed race High on our countrys scroll we fondly trace In lines of fadeless light that softly blend Emancipator hero martyr friend While Freedom may her holy sceptre claim The world shall echo with Our Lincolns name
What sudden ill the world await     From my dear residence I roam I must deplore the bitter fate     To straggle from my native home  The verdant willow droops her head     And seems to bid a fare thee well The flowers with tears their fragrance shed     Alas their parting tale to tell  Tis like the loss of Paradise     Or Edens garden left in gloom Where grief affords us no device     Such is thy lot my native home  I never never shall forget     My sad departure far away Until the sun of life is set     And leaves behind no beam of day  How can I from my seat remove     And leave my ever devoted home And the dear garden which I love     The beauty of my native home  Alas sequestered set aside     It is a mournful tale to tell Tis like a lone deserted bride     That bade her bridegroom fare thee well  I trust I soon shall dry the tear     And leave forever hence to roam Far from a residence so dear     The place of beautymy native home
He is gone the strong base of the nation     The dove to his covet has fled Ye heroes lament his privation     For Lincoln is dead  He is gone down the sun of the Union     Like Phoebus that sets in the west The planet of peace and communion     Forever has gone to his rest  He is gone down from a world of commotion     No equal succeeds in his stead His wonders extend with the ocean     Whose waves murmur Lincoln is dead  He is gone and can neer be forgotten     Whose great deeds eternal shall bloom When gold pearls and diamonds are rotten     His deeds will break forth from the tomb  He is gone out of glory to glory     A smile with the tear may be shed O then let us tell the sweet story     Triumphantly Lincoln is dead
Dedicated to the Federal and Late Confederate Soldiers
Like heartloving brothers we meet
    And still the loud thunders of strife
The blaze of fraternity kindles most sweet
    Theres nothing more pleasing in life 
The black cloud of faction retreats
    The poor is no longer depressed
See those once discarded resuming their seats
    The lost strangers soon will find rest 
The soldier no longer shall roam
    But soon shall land safely ashore
Each soon will arrive at his own native home
    And struggle in warfare no more 
The union of brothers is sweet
    Whose wives and children do come
Their sons and fair daughters with pleasure they greet
    When long absent fathers come home 
They never shall languish again
    Nor discord their union shall break
When brothers no longer lament and complain
    Hence never each other forsake 
Hang closely together like friends
    By peace killing foes never driven
The storm of commotion eternally ends
    And earth will soon turn into Heaven

Ye elms that wave on Malvern Hill      In prime of morn and May Recall ye how McClellans men      Here stood at bay While deep within yon forest dim      Our rigid comrades lay Some with the cartridge in their mouth Others with fixed arms lifted South             Invoking so The cypress glades Ah wilds of woe   The spires of Richmond late beheld      Through rifts in muskethaze Were closed from view in clouds of dust      On leafwalled ways Where streamed our wagons in caravan      And the Seven Nights and Days Of march and fast retreat and fight Pinched our grimed faces to ghastly plight             Does the elm wood Recall the haggard beards of blood   The battlesmoked flag with stars eclipsed      We followed it never fell In silence husbanded our strength           Received their yell Till on this slope we patient turned      With cannon ordered well Reverse we proved was not defeat But ah the sod what thousands meet                Does Malvern Wood Bethink itself and muse and brood                           We elms of Malvern Hill                             Remember every thing                        But sap the twig will fill                        Wag the world how it will                             Leaves must be green in Spring
A Night Piece        July 1863
No sleep The sultriness pervades the air And binds the braina dense oppression such As tawny tigers feel in matted shades Vexing their blood and making apt for ravage Beneath the stars the roofy desert spreads Vacant as Libya All is hushed near by Yet fitfully from far breaks a mixed surf Of muffled sound the atheist roar of riot Yonder where parching Sirius set in drought Balefully glares red Arsonthereand there The town is taken by its ratsshiprats And rats of the wharves All civil charms And priestly spells which late held hearts in awe Fearbound subjected to a better sway Than sway of self these like a dream dissolve And man rebounds whole aeons back in nature Hail to the low dull rumble dull and dead And ponderous drag that shakes the wall Wise Draco comes deep in the midnight roll Of black artillery he comes though late In code corroborating Calvins creed And cynic tyrannies of honest kings He comes nor parlies and the Town redeemed Gives thanks devout nor being thankful heeds The grimy slur on the Republics faith implied Which holds that Man is naturally good Andmoreis Natures Roman never to be scourged

Listless he eyes the palisades      And sentries in the glare Tis barren as a pelicanbeach      But his world is ended there   Nothing to do and vacant hands      Bring on the idiotpain He tries to thinkto recollect      But the blur is on his brain   Around him swarm the plaining ghosts      Like those on Virgils shore A wilderness of faces dim      And pale ones gashed and hoar   A smiting sun No shed no tree      He totters to his lair A den that sick hands dug in earth      Ere famine wasted there   Or dropping in his place he swoons      Walled in by throngs that press Till forth from the throngs they bear him dead       Dead in his meagerness
He rides at their head     A crutch by his saddle just slants in view One slung arm is in splints you see     Yet he guides his strong steedhow coldly too   He brings his regiment home     Not as they filed two years before But a remnant halftattered and battered and worn Like castaway sailors whostunned           By the surfs loud roar     Their mates dragged back and seen no more Again and again breast the surge     And at last crawl spent to shore   A still rigidity and pale     An Indian aloofness lones his brow He has lived a thousand years Compressed in battles pains and prayers     Marches and watches slow There are welcoming shouts and flags     Old men off hat to the Boy Wreaths from gay balconies fall at his feet     But to himthere comes alloy   It is not that a leg is lost     It is not that an arm is maimed It is not that the fever has racked     Self he has long disclaimed   But all through the Seven Days Fight     And deep in the Wilderness grim And in the fieldhospital tent     And Petersburg crater and dim Lean brooding in Libby there came     Ah heavenwhat truth to him

Good Friday was the day     Of the prodigy and crime When they killed him in his pity     When they killed him in his prime Of clemency and calm          When with yearning he was filled          To redeem the evilwilled And though conqueror be kind     But they killed him in his kindness     In their madness and their blindness And they killed him from behind                 There is sobbing of the strong                    And a pall upon the land               But the People in their weeping                                     Bare the iron hand               Beware the People weeping                    When they bare the iron hand   He lieth in his blood     The father in his face They have killed him the Forgiver     The Avenger takes his place The Avenger wisely stern          Who in righteousness shall do          What heavens call him to And the parricides remand     For they killed him in his kindness     In their madness and their blindness And his blood is on their hand                       There is sobbing of the strong                         And a pall upon the land                     But the People in their weeping                                     Bare the iron hand                     Beware the People weeping                         When they bare the iron hand
Calm as that second summer which precedes        The first fall of the snow In the broad sunlight of heroic deeds        The City bides the foe   As yet behind their ramparts stern and proud        Her bolted thunders sleep Dark Sumter like a battlemented cloud        Looms oer the solemn deep   No Calpe frowns from lofty cliff or scar        To guard the holy strand But Moultrie holds in leash her dogs of war        Above the level sand   And down the dunes a thousand guns lie couched        Unseen beside the flood Like tigers in some Orient jungle crouched         That wait and watch for blood   Meanwhile through streets still echoing with trade        Walk grave and thoughtful men Whose hands may one day wield the patriots blade        As lightly as the pen   And maidens with such eyes as would grow dim        Over a bleeding hound Seem each one to have caught the strength of him        Whose sword she sadly bound   Thus girt without and garrisoned at home        Day patient following day Old Charleston looks from roof and spire and dome        Across her tranquil bay   Ships through a hundred foes from Saxon lands        And spicy Indian ports Bring Saxon steel and iron to her hands        And summer to her courts   But still along you dim Atlantic line        The only hostile smoke Creeps like a harmless mist above the brine        From some frail floating oak   Shall the spring dawn and she still clad in smiles        And with an unscathed brow Rest in the strong arms of her palmcrowned isles        As fair and free as now   We know not in the temple of the Fates        God has inscribed her doom And all untroubled in her faith she waits        The triumph or the tomb
Two armies stand enrolled beneath The banner with the starry wreath One facing battle blight and blast Through twice a hundred fields has passed Its deeds against a ruffian foe Steam valley hill and mountain know Till every wind that sweeps the land Goes glory laden from the strand   The other with a narrower scope Yet led by not less grand a hope Hath won perhaps as proud a place And wears its fame with meeker grace Wives march beneath its glittering sign Fond mothers swell the lovely line And many a sweetheart hides her blush In the young patriots generous flush   No breeze of battle ever fanned The colors of that tender band Its office is beside the bed Where throbs some sick or wounded head It does not court the soldiers tomb But plies the needle and the loom And by a thousand peaceful deeds Supplies a struggling nations needs   Nor is that armys gentle might Unfelt amid the deadly fight It nerves the sons the husbands hand It points the lovers fearless brand It thrills the languid warms the cold Gives even new courage to the bold And sometimes lifts the veriest clod To its own lofty trust in God   When Heaven shall blow the trump of peace And bid this weary warfare cease Their several missions nobly done The triumph grasped and freedom won Both armies from their toils at rest Alike may claim the victors crest But each shall see its dearest prize Gleam softly from the others eyes
One day in the dreamy summer     On the Sabbath hills from afar We heard the solemn echoes     Of the first fierce words of war   Ah tell me thou veilèd Watcher     Of the storm and the calm to come How long by the sun or shadow     Till these noises again are dumb   And soon in a hush and glimmer     We thought of the dark strange fight Whose close in a ghastly quiet     Lay dim in the beautiful night   Then we talkd of coldness and pallor     And of things with blinded eyes That stared at the golden stillness     Of the moon in those lighted skies   And of souls at morning wrestling     In the dust with passion and moan So far away at evening     In the silence of worlds unknown   But a delicate wind beside us     Was rustling the dusky hours As it gatherd the dewy odors     Of the snowy jessamineflowers   And I gave you a spray of the blossoms     And said I shall never know How the hearts in the land are breaking     My dearest unless you go
At Arlington 1866
The summer blew its little drifts of sound     Tangled with wet leafshadows and the light Small breath of scattered morning budsaround The yellow path through which our footsteps wound     Below the Capitol rose glittering white  There stretched a sleeping army One by one     They took their places until thousands met No leaders stars flashed on before and none Leaned on his sword or staggerd with his gun     I wonder if their feet have rested yet  They saw the dust they joined the moving mass     They answerd the fierce musics cry for blood Then straggled here and lay down in the grass Wear flowers for such shores whence their feet did pass     Sing tenderly O rivers haunted flood  They had been sick and worn and weary when     They stoppd on this calm hill beneath the trees Yet if in some redclouded dawn again The country should be calling to her men     Shall the reveille not remember these  Around them underneath the midday skies     The dreadful phantoms of the living walk And by low moons and darkness with their cries The mothers sisters wives with faded eyes     Who call still names amid their broken talk  And there is one who comes alone and stands     At his dim fireless hearthchilld and oppressd By Something he had summond to his lands While the weird pallor of its many hands     Points to his rusted sword in his own breast
So because you chose to follow me into the subtle sadness of night     And to stand in the halfset moon with the weird falllight on your glimmering hair Till your presence hid all of the earth and all of the sky from my sight     And to give me a little scarlet bud that was dying of frost to wear  Say must you taunt me forever forever You looked at my hand and you knew     That I was the slave of the Ring while you were as free as the wind is free When I saw your corpse in your coffin I flung back your flower to you     It was all of yours that I ever had you may keep it andkeep from me  Ah so God is your witness Has God then no world to look after but ours     May He not have been searching for that wild stat with the trailing plumage that         flew Far over a part of our darkness while we were there by the freezing flowers     Or else brightening some planets luminous rings instead of thinking of you  Or if He was near us at all do you think that He would sit listening there     Because you sang Hear me Norma to a woman in jewels and lace While so close to us down in another street in the wet unlighted air     There were children crying for bread and fire and mothers who questioned His         grace  Or perhaps He had gone to the ghastly field where the fight had been that day     To number the bloody stabs that were there to look at and judge the dead Or else to the place full of fever and moans where the wretched wounded lay     At least I do not believe that He cares to remember a word that you said  So take back your flowers I tell youof its sweetness I now have no need     Yes take back your flower down into the stillness and mystery to keep When you wake I will take it and God then perhaps will witness indeed     But go now and tell Death he must watch you and not let you walk in your sleep
Blow back the breath of the bird     Scatter the song through the air There was music you never heard     And cannot hear anywhere  It was not the sob of the vain     In the old old dark so sweet I shall never hear it again     Nor the coming of fairy feet  It was music and music alone     Not a sigh from a lovers mouth Now it comes in a phantom moan     From the dead and buried South  It was savage and fierce and glad     It played with the heart at will Oh what a wizard touch it had     Oh if I could hear it still  Were they slaves They were not then     The music had made them free They were happy women and men     What more do we care to be  There is blood and blackness and dust     There are terrible things to see There are stories of swords that rust     Between that music and me  Dark ghosts with your ghostly tunes     Come back till I laugh through tears Dance under the sunken moons     Dance over the grassy years  Hush hushI know it I say     Your armies were bright and brave But the music they took away     Was worthwhatever they gave
My boy not of your will nor mine     You keep the mountain pass and wait Restless for evil gold to shine     And hold you to your fate  A stronger Hand than yours gave you     The lawless swordyou know not why That you must live is all too true     And other men must die  My boy be brigand if you must     But face the traveller in your track Stand one to one and never thrust     The dagger in his back  Nay make no ambush of the dark     Look straight into your victims eyes Thenlet his free soul like a lark     Fly singing toward the skies  My boy if Christ must be betrayed     And you must the betrayer be Oh marked before the worlds were made     What help is there for me  Ah if the prophets from their graves     Demand such blood of you as this Take Him I say with swords and staves     Butnever with a kiss
After the news the forecaster crowed With excitement about his bad tidings Eighteen inches of snow Take cover A little shiver ran through the community Children abandoned their homework Who cared about the hypotenuse now The snowplow driver laid out his long johns The old couple whod barked at each other At supper smiled shyly turned off the TV And climbed the stairs to their queensize bed Heaped high with blankets and quiltsAnd the aging husky they failed to hear Scratch the back door turned around twice In the yard settled herself in the snow And covered her nose with her tail
As cars pass laboring through the slush a boy bundled against the stiff wind in his snow suit gloves and scarf leans on his upright tobogganwaiting his turn atop the snowpacked overpassthe highest point in town First one car exits and then another each creeping down the icy ramp The brown grass pokes through the two grooves carved in the short hill As the second car fishtails to a stop at the bottom brake lights glowing on the dirty snow the boys turn comes His trip to the bottom is swift only a second or two and he bails out just before the curb Its not much but its sledding in Wichita
Draped in towels my grandmother sits in a hardbacked chair a white bowlof soapy water on the floor She lifts her frail arm then rests itgratefully in her daughters palm Gliding a wetwashcloth my mothers hand becomes a cloud and every bruise a rain drenched flower
Its the way they cannot understand the window they buzz and buzz against the bees that take a wrong turn at my door and end up thus in a drift at first of almost idle curiosity cruising the room until they find themselves smack up against it and they cannot fathom how the air has hardened and the world they know with their eyes keeps out of reach as stuck there with all they want just in front of them they must fling their bodies against the one unalterable law of thingsthis fact of glassand can only go on making the sound that tethers their electricfury to whats impossible feeling the sting in it
Einsteins happiest moment occurred when he realized a falling man falling beside a falling applecould also be described as an apple and a man at rest while the world falls around themAnd my happiest moment occurred when I realized you were falling for me right down to the core and the rest relatively speaking has flown past faster than the speed of light
for Hannah
The way my daughter sleeps its as if shes talking
to the dead Now she is one I watch her eyes roll
backwards in her head her senses fold
one by one and then her breathing quiets to a beat
Every night she fights this silent way of being
with all the whining ammunition that she has
She wins a tired story a smothered song the small
and willful links to life that carry her away
Welcome to the Egyptian burial Shes gone to Hades
with her stuffed animals When she wakes
the sad circles disappeared she blinks
before she knows me I have listened
to one million breaths of her And every night
my body seizes when she leaves to go
where I am not and yet every night I urge her go
I will not tend Or water
pull or yank
I will not till uproot
fill up or spray
The rain comes
Or not Plants sunfed
moonhopped dirtstuck
Watch as flocks
of wild phlox
appear disappear My lazy
garbagey magic
makes this nothing
happen
I love
the tattered
camisole of
nothing The world
runs its underbrush
course fed by
the nothing I give it
Wars are fought
Blood turns
Dirt is a wide unruly room
     Thanks Ray this is just what the doctor ordered
     No you never see me have one with olivesyour father likes
olives but I cant stand them
     No cocktail onions are just picked small Turn that down Dan
            Avocados toothpicks Coleus root sprawl
            The diffident glints of a lateday sun rays
            splintered by leaves they shake and in their
            shaking streak the light Transparent murk
            of glasses at the glass
     Would you move just one inch over There The light was in my eye
            Oh dangling long sleeves in the Mercurochrome
            Parking her punch on her knees
     Im not a joiner
            In the night a visitation small as a thumb
            enters the sealed house and ascends
     Mother wouldnt have stood for that long Drippydrooping around
on heels Leaving the blue cheese out
                                        Now that the salt of their blood    
Stiffens the saltier oblivion of the sea

We leave Gulfport at noon gulls overhead
trailing the boatstreamers noisy fanfare
all the way to Ship Island What we see
first is the fort its roof of grass a lee
half reminder of the men who served there
a weathered monument to some of the dead
Inside we follow the ranger hurried
though we are to get to the beach He tells
of graves lost in the Gulf the island split
in half when Hurricane Camille hit
shows us casemates cannons the store that sells
souvenirs tokens of history long buried
The Daughters of the Confederacy
has placed a plaque here at the forts entrance
each Confederate soldiers name raised hard
in bronze no names carved for the Native Guards
2nd Regiment Union men black phalanx
What is monument to their legacy
All the grave markers all the crude headstones
waterlost Now fish dart among their bones
and we listen for what the waves intone
Only the fort remains near forty feet high
round unfinished half open to the sky
the elementswind rainGods deliberate eye
We tell the story every year
how we peered from the windows shades drawn
though nothing really happened
the charred grass now green again
We peered from the windows shades drawn
at the cross trussed like a Christmas tree
the charred grass still green Then
we darkened our rooms lit the hurricane lamps
At the cross trussed like a Christmas tree
a few men gathered white as angels in their gowns
We darkened our rooms and lit hurricane lamps
the wicks trembling in their fonts of oil
It seemed the angels had gathered white men in their gowns
When they were done they left quietly No one came
The wicks trembled all night in their fonts of oil
by morning the flames had all dimmed
When they were done the men left quietly No one came
Nothing really happened
By morning all the flames had dimmed
We tell the story every year
In 1965 my parents broke two laws of Mississippi
they went to Ohio to marry returned to Mississippi
They crossed the river into Cincinnati a city whose name
begins with a sound like sin the sound of wrongmis in Mississippi
A year later they moved to Canada followed a route the same
as slaves the train slicing the white glaze of winter leaving Mississippi
Faulkners Joe Christmas was born in winter like Jesus given his name
for the day he was left at the orphanage his race unknown in Mississippi
My father was reading War and Peace when he gave me my name
I was born near Easter 1966 in Mississippi
When I turned 33 my father said Its your Jesus yearyoure the sameage he was when he died It was spring the hills green in Mississippi
I know more than Joe Christmas did Natasha is a Russian name
though Im not it means Christmas child even in Mississippi
I was asleep while you were dying
Its as if you slipped through some rift a hollow
I make between my slumber and my waking
the Erebus I keep you in still trying
not to let go Youll be dead again tomorrow
but in dreams you live So I try taking
you back into morning Sleepheavy turning
my eyes open I find you do not follow
Again and again this constant forsaking
Again and again this constant forsaking
my eyes open I find you do not follow
You back into morning sleepheavy turning
But in dreams you live So I try taking
not to let go Youll be dead again tomorrow
The Erebus I keep you instill trying
I make between my slumber and my waking
Its as if you slipped through some rift a hollow
I was asleep while you were dying

I returned to a stand of pines
                            bonethin phalanx
flanking the roadside tangle
                            of understorya dialectic of dark
and lightand magnolias blossoming
                            like afterthought each flower
a surrender white flags draped
                            among the branches I returned
to lands end the swath of coast
                            clear cut and buried in sand
mangrove live oak gulfweed
                            razed and replaced by thin palms
palmettossymbols of victory
                            or defiance over and over
marking this vanquished land I returned
                            to a field of cotton hallowed ground
as slave legend goeseach boll
                            holding the ghosts of generations
those who measured their days
                            by the heft of sacks and lengths
of rows whose sweat flecked the cotton plants
                            still sewn into our clothes
I returned to a country battlefield
                            where colored troops fought and died
Port Hudson where their bodies swelled
                            and blackened beneath the sununburied
until earths green sheet pulled over them
                            unmarked by any headstones
Where the roads buildings and monuments
                            are named to honor the Confederacy
where that old flag still hangs I return
                            to Mississippi state that made a crime
of memulatto halfbreednative
                            in my native land this place theyll bury me
You can get there from here though
theres no going home
Everywhere you go will be somewhere
youve never been Try this

Civil War Photography by T OSullivan 1866
Raisinblack blood dries on their faces
Thick wool clothes
Lumps of bloated bodies
lying on their backs
Mouths open Chins
pointing to the sky
As though blown over backward
Or turned
Fingers swollen
Boots and rifles missing
Coats and jackets pulled up
exposing gray shirts bloody underwear
The sky drifts toward sap green
No fences No stone walls
When the soldiers came in their dirty blue shirts
I was kneeling in the garden in the rain
That year only a few ramblers were left
and the trellis had collapsed from the wind
Still I was glad for the water and darkness that clotted the air
the days had seemed sour to me in spite of
the glory of the vegetables wandering into fall
the fat swollen apples and the wild roses
creeping under the lilac And there as the men approached
I stood up near the two willow saplings
sprouted from posts but driven in
the larger one by the neighbor boy
when he entered service the smaller one
when he returned home I could see
the street from where I stood as though wrapped
in gauze heavy with the nests of caterpillars
Next week a man with rags tied to sticks
would dip them in kerosene and
burn the worms that would then drop
squirming onto his arms his hair the street
And then I thought I was lying at the bottom of a pond
edged with grayish leaves and looking up to the surface
I saw leaves raindrops shattering the sky
like splinters of glass drifting toward my body
noises seemed echoes as I continued to distance myself
from what had happened After that
a disbelief perhaps I had had a stroke hit my head
or fallen asleep and woke to flies banging against my face
I saw edges of myself being flattened by rain
could smell the earth too and thought of the years
of rot that made the smell the rot of my father and his father
and all those who had gone before and how we eat the root
of the earth and then turn into rot ourselves just as
pieces of dirt were grinding away between my teeth and tongue
my bit of gristle being stirred into earths stew
I began to raise my head and noticed
for the first time the bunting
red white and blue hung out for the parade
He could have stayed in the city
photographed the cheese and oyster boys after the war
opalcolored orphans or ladies of unfortunate standing
back when tall buildings still believed in America
back when concrete was still a thing of splendor
Instead he went West to rehabilitate his grief
Always the white sky
Always the dark figures lost in an immense world
full of danger and disaster starvation and storms
of mosquitoes thick enough to snuff out candles
Provisions lost in a blazing sun that watched
constantly Twice hit by shell fragments
once by tuberculosis
Dead at 42
The fortunate thing about his camera
was its ability to stray
to put things in that didnt belong
like footprints in the sand
Here is the photographer and his party
exploring the great canyons of the West
while their clothes dry on the line
The white train emerges from a dark curtain
of tall fir trees with its coat of light snow
The white train appears as though newly escaped
from the jaws of night The white train steams
out of the forest into the clear white
meadow melting the fresh snow around it
The trees are towering Ancient giants
A whole section seems to have been logged
Over there the folded arms of soldiers who
gather in small groups We cannot see
leaders or individual faces Horsemen far away
On their way to the revolution perhaps
In the dining car behind the velvet curtains
blood puddings and sea pie clear soups
and small marrow Already today
the chef has cooked three luncheons
while crossing Poland the starched
waiters managed without spilling a drop
Dozens of dirty white napkins heap on hampers
like miniature Alps threatening to fall But
now the train has braked and stopped Small boys
fog the windows with their warm breath
as they watch the soldiers with silver sabers who
order everyone off the train into the new snow
1
Somewhere Indians are walking across America
One is a woman caught in stride
between two white birches her eyes
on the ground her mouth
biting open a word while the wind
shreds the lake behind her
2
A boy wakes alone in cold New England air
From his window he watches his fathers breath
mix with the steam from cows urine
A white blanket of sheep has unrolled
across the hill and the yellow dogs
who ran and ran have now disappeared
3
A glass necklace floats on her white breast
just as she herself floats inside his lens
while he watches from under the dark hood
her small black eardrops hang perfectly still
her long white neck and cleavage ready to be
frozen forever by the touch of his finger
4
As the deer ate from the deep lawn
and the fish jumped near the willow trees
the big white ferry paused briefly before sliding
back again across the lake completely
unaware of its brightness and its beauty
Inside inside the return inside the hero diminishes
Over her vessel they place a veil and when it is lifted
the name of the vessel has been lost Consider
the darkness of the water which has no scent
and neither can it swallow Yet the ships bow
extends over the proscenium like a horse
at a fence and the orchestra stands and files out
On the long walk home I long to see your face
Summers sweet theatrum The boy lunges through
The kitchen without comment slams the door An
Elaborate evening drama I lug his forlorn weight
From floor to bed Beatific lips and gap
Toothed Who stayed late to mope and swim then
Breach chimneys of lake like a hooked gar
Pressing his wet totality against me Iridescent
Laughter and depraved Chromatic his constant state At
Ten childhood took off like a scorched dog Turned
His head to see my hand wave from a window and I too saw
The hand untouching distant from What fathering
Fear slaked the impulse to embrace him Duration
An indefinite continuation of life I whirled out wings Going
Toward And Lord Child claimed now climbing loose
Against the backdark bright
                              riband flickers of heat lightning    Nearer
                hills begin to show to come clear
                                                             as a hard detached
                                                                                            and glimmering brim
                                             against light lifting there    And here pitched over
the braided arroyo choked with debris
                                                             a tent its wan cakey
                                roadrur color    On the front stake two
                green dragonflies riding each other pause
                                             Look cries the boy running the father behind him
                                 running too
                                                               and the canyon opening
                out in front of them its magisterial consequence cramming
                               vertiginous air down its throat
                                                                                           to snatch him
                                                                    from the scarp
When the strong drag of the boys adolescence pulls through them the
family rises into thinness and begins to break like a wave
You turned away when I kissed you the woman says Why
Halflidded days of early winter
When he points toward the woman the boy looks at his hand the way dogs
will
The boys jaw sets As though behind his teeth into the soft flesh of his
throat a new set of teeth were cutting through A mouth for what
Each of them adopts a private view Arguments veer every which way and
who can follow A sequence of dark non sequiturs blows in
When one when one word when the word suicide enters the room where
they are shouting the system closes down prematurely becalmed
The man writes I am not given a subject but am given to my subject I
am inside it like a parasite
He sees the womans face contract at the approach of other futures than the
one for which her face was prepared
So they inhabit their bodies like music for a given time And yet he
continues to act as if there were times to come
I just want you to go away one of them screams
Expressionless and flat as a tortilla the afternoon moon over their house
She calls the man to a corner in the basement Those arent spider eggs he
says backing up Those are its eyes
When the encounter with the self is volcanic nothing can follow
Tearing open the cocoon to reveal itself a boy within the family
As if they were waiting As if inside experience bright with meaning
there were another experience pendant unnameable
Our eye goes past the hieroglyphic tree to the swimmer
carving a wake in the water And almost to the railroad bridge
from which the swimmer might have dived Then as though
come to the end of its tether
our gaze returns pulling toward the blemish
on the surface of the print An Lshaped chemical dribble
it sabotages the scenes transparence
and siphons off its easy appeal
At the same time the blemish
joins together the realms
of seer and swimmer
in our experience of plunging
into and out of the image
The bioluminescent undersides of squid render them invisible to predators
below That the radiance of the boys anger might protect him
Walking the dog and stepping on a patch of repaired road I remember the
soft spot in his head
Youre deaf as a beagle No you are
Can I feel the tides drag on the turning earth increase each days duration
A hair in my nostril has gone white
In absolute night from my bed I hear him aiming for the toilets center
The sound deepens voice finding its register
Scientists call it an entangled system
We survive Christmas his face pressed to the smooshed bosom of his
grandmother in a house so immaculate the spider in the seam of the
ceiling stands out obscenely
Like a star at the outskirts of the galaxy and slung around by the gravity of
dark matter For now he goes where we go but he does not belong to us
I begin to begin my sentences leaning toward him taking a deep breath
He relinquishes the conversation with a contraction of his pupils
What is for one of us the throb of the immediate is for the other the
imminent mundane
When napalm hits my brain he takes on the tranquillity of a blinking
newt
She finds a photograph of him at seven The sheer expressed of his face As
among Michelangelos early drawings there is a copy of Masacchios lostSagra the consecration 
We search our memories of him for a certain unity of characteristics that
would hold through the permutations he now submits to us 
When it clings to the wireandrug surrogate lab technicians shock it
again Instead of releasing it clings tighter 
Throwing himself into the back seat after wrestling practice mat burns on
his cheek and forehead 
His muteness an onomatopoeia of the rising moon
Sweet beats of jazz impaled on slivers of wind
Kansas Black Morning First Horn Eyes
Historical sound pictures on New Bird wings
People shouts boy alto dreams Tomorrows
Gold belled pipe of stops and future Blues Times
Lurking Hawkins shadows of Lester realization
Bronze fingersbrain extensions seeking trapped sounds
Ghetto thoughts bandstand courage solo flight
Nervewracked suspicions of newer songs and doubts
New York alter city black tears secret disciples
Hammer horn pounding soul marks on unswinging gates
Culture gods mob sounds visions of spikes
Panic excursions to tribal Jazz wombs and transfusions
Heroin nights of birth and soaring over boppy new ground
Smothered rage covering pyramids of notes spontaneously exploding
Cool revelations shrill hopes beauty speared into greedy ears
Birdland nights on bop mountains windy saxophone revolutions
Dayrooms of junk and melting walls and circling vultures
Money cancer remembered pain terror flights
Death and indestructible existence 
In that Jazz corner of life
Wrapped in a mist of sound
His legacy our Jazztinted dawn
Wailing his triumphs of oddly begotten dreams
Inviting the nerveless to feel once more
That fierce dying of humans consumed
In raging fires of Love
THE NIGHT THAT LORCA COMES
SHALL BE A STRANGE NIGHT IN THE
SOUTH IT SHALL BE THE TIME WHEN NEGROES LEAVE THE
SOUTH
        FOREVER
GREEN TRAINS SHALL ARRIVE
FROM RED PLANET MARS
CRACKLING BLUENESS SHALL SEND TOOTHCOVERED CARS FOR
THEM
TO LEAVE IN TO GO INTO
THE NORTH FOREVER AND I SEE MY LITTLE GIRL MOTHER
AGAIN WITH HER CROSS THAT
IS NOT BURNING HER SKIRTS
OF BLACK OF ALL COLORS HER AURA
OF FAMILIARITY THE SOUTH SHALL WEEP
BITTER TEARS TO NO AVAIL
THE NEGROES HAVE GONE
INTO CRACKLING BLUENESS
CRISPUS ATTUCKS SHALL ARRIVE WITH THE BOSTON
COMMONS TO TAKE ELISSI LANDI
NORTH CRISPUS ATTUCKS SHALL
BE LAYING ON BOSTON COMMONS

THE WHITE SOUTH SHALL GATHER AT
PRESERVATION HALL
   might have been
Certainly these ashes might have been pleasures
Pilgrims on their way to the Holy Places remark
this place Isnt it plain to all
that these mounds were palaces This was once
a city among men a gathering together of spirit
It was measured by the Lord and found wanting 
It was measured by the Lord and found wanting
destroyd by the angels that inhabit longing
Surely this is Great Sodom where such cries
as if men were birds flying up from the swamp
ring in our ears where such fears that were once
desires walk almost spectacular
stalking the desolate circles red eyed 
This place rumord to have been a City surely was
separated from us by the hand of the Lord
The devout have laid out gardens in the desert
drawn water from springs where the light was blighted
How tenderly they must attend these friendships
or all is lost All is lost
Only the faithful hold this place green 
Only the faithful hold this place green
where the crown of fiery thorns descends
Men that once lusted grow listless A spirit
wrappd in a cloud ashes more than ashes
fire more than fire ascends
Only these new friends gather joyous here
where the world like Great Sodom lies under fear The world like Great Sodom lies under Loveand knows not the hand of the Lord that moves
This the friends teach where such cries
as if men were birds fly up from the crowds
gatherd and howling in the heat of the sun
In the Lord Whom the friends have named at last Love
the images and loves of the friends never die
This place rumord to have been Sodom is blessd
in the Lords eyes
In the shape of this night in the still fall
        of snow Father
In all that is cold and tiny these little birds
        and children
In everything that moves tonight the trolleys
        and the lovers Father
In the great hush of country in the ugly noise
        of our cities
In this deep throw of stars in those trenches
        where the dead are Father
In all the wide land waiting and in the liners
        out on the black water
In all that has been said bravely in all that is
        mean anywhere in the world Father
In all that is good and lovely in every house
        where sham and hatred are
In the name of those who wait in the sound
        of angry voices Father
Before the bells ring before this little point in time
        has rushed us on
Before this clean moment has gone before this night
        turns to face tomorrow Father
There is this high singing in the air
Forever this sorrowful human face in eternitys window
And there are other bells that we would ring Father
Other bells that we would ring
I sigh for the heavenly country
Where the heavenly people pass
And the sea is as quiet as a mirror
Of beautiful beautiful glass
I walk in the heavenly field
With lilies and poppies bright
I am dressed in a heavenly coat
Of polished white
When I walk in the heavenly parkland
My feet on the pasture are bare
Tall waves the grass but no harmful
Creature is there
At night I fly over the housetops
And stand on the bright moony beams
Gold are all heavens rivers
And silver her streams
I saw the garden where my aunt had died
And her two children and a woman from next door
It was like a burst pod filled with clay
A mile away in the night I had heard the bombs
Sing and then burst themselves between cramped houses
With bright soft flashes and sounds like banging doors
The last of them crushed the four bodies into the ground
Scattered the shelter and blasted my uncles corpse
Over the housetop and into the street beyond
Now the garden lay stripped and stale the iron shelter
Spread out its separate petals around a smooth clay saucer
Small and so tidy it seemed nobody had ever been there
When I saw it the house was blown clean by blast and care
Relations had already torn out the new fireplaces
My cousins pencils lasted me several years
And in his office notepad that was given me
I found solemn drawings in crayon of blondes without dresses
In his lifetime I had not known him well
These were the things I noticed at ten years of age
Those and the four hearses outside our house
The chocolate cakes and my classmates halfshocked envy
But my grandfather went home from the mortuary
And for five years tried to share the noises in his skull
Then he walked out and lay under a furzebush to die
When my father came back from identifying the daughter
He asked us to remind him of her mouth
We tried He said I think it was the one
These were marginal people I had met only rarely
And the end of the whole household meant that no grief was seen
Never have people seemed so absent from their own deaths
This bloody episode of four whom I could understand better dead
Gave me something I needed to keep a long story moving
I had no pain of it can find no scar even now
But had my belief in the fiction not been thus buoyed up
I might in the sigh and strike of the next nights bombs
Have realized a little what they meant and for the first time been afraid
At night on the station platform near a pile of baskets a couple em
braced pressed close together and swaying a little It was hard to
see where the girls feet and legs were The suspicion this aroused
soon caused her hands apparently joined behind her lovers back
to become a small brown paper parcel under the arm of a stout en
ginedriver who leaned probably drunk against the baskets his
cap so far forward as almost to conceal his face I could not banish
the thought that what I had first seen was in fact his own androgy
nous fantasy the selfsufficient core of his stupor Such a romantic
thing so tender for him to contain He looked more comic and
complaisant than the couple had done and more likely to fall heav
ily to the floor
A café with a frosted glass door through which much light is dif
fused A tall young girl comes out and stands in front of it her face
and figure quite obscured by this milky radiance
She treads out onto a lopsided ochre panel of lit pavement before
the doorway and becomes visible as a coloured shape moving
sharply A wrap of honey and ginger a flared saffron skirt grey
white shoes She goes off past the Masonic Temple with a young
man he is pale with dark hair and a shrunken earnest face You
could imagine him a size larger Just for a moment as it happens
there is no one else in the street at all Their significance escapes rap
idly like a scent before the footsteps vanish among the car engines
A man in the police court He looked dapper and pokerfaced his
arms straight the long fingers just touching the hem of his checked
jacket Four days after being released from the prison where he had
served two years for theft he had been discovered at midnight cling
ing like a treeshrew to the bars of a glass factoryroof He made no
attempt to explain his presence there the luminous nerves that
made him fly up to it were not visible in daylight and the police
seemed hardly able to believe this was the creature they had brought
down in the darkness
In this city the governing authority is limited and mean so limited
that it can do no more than preserve a superficial order It supplies
fuel water and power It removes a fair proportion of the refuse
cleans the streets after a fashion and discourages fighting With
these things and a few more of the same sort it is content This
could never be a capital city for all its size There is no mind in it no
regard The sensitive the tasteful the fashionable the intolerant
and powerful have not moved through it as they have moved
through London evaluating it altering it deliberately setting in
motion wars of feeling about it Most of it has never been seen
In an afternoon of dazzling sunlight in the thronged streets I saw
at first no individuals but a composite monster its unfeeling sur
faces matted with dust a mass of necks limbs without extremities
trunks without heads unformed stirrings and shovings spilling
across the streets it had managed to get itself provided with
Later as the air cooled flowing loosely about the buildings that
stood starkly among the declining rays the creature began to divide
and multiply At crossings I could see people made of straws rags
cartons the stuffing of burst cushions kitchen refuse Outside the
Grand Hotel a longboned carrothaired girl with glasses loping
along and with strips of bright colour rich silky green and blue
in her soft clothes For a person made of such scraps she was beau
tiful
Faint blue light dropping down through the sparse leaves of the
plane trees in the churchyard opposite after sundown cooling and
shaping heads awakening eyes
The pianist Joe Sullivan
jamming sound against idea
hard as it can go
florid and dangerous
slams at the beat or hovers
drumming along its spikes
in his time almost the only
one of them to ignore
the chance of easing down
walking it leisurely
hell strut with gambling shapes
underpinning by James P
amble and stride over
gulfs of his own leaving perilously
toppling octaves down to where
the chords grow fat again
and ride hardedged most lucidly
voiced and in good inversions even when
the piano seems at risk of being
hammered the next second into scrap
For all that he wont swing
like all the others
disregards mere continuity
the snakecharming business
the masturbators rhythm
under the long variations
Sullivan can gut a sequence
in one chorus
approach development climax discard
and sound magnanimous
The mannerism of intensity
often with him seems true
too much to be said the mood
pressing in right at the start then
running among stock forms
that could play themselves
and moving there with such
quickness of intellect
that shapes flaw and fuse
altering without much sign
concentration
so wrapped up in thoroughness
it can sound bluff bustling
just bighanded stuff
belied by what drives him in
to make rigid display
shout and abscond rather
than just let it come let it go
And that thing is his mood
a feeling violent and ordinary
that runs in among standard forms so
wrapped up in clarity
that fingers following his
through figures that sound obvious
find corners everywhere
marks of invention wakefulness
the rapid and perverse
tracks that ordinary feelings
make when they get driven
hard enough against time
The irritations of comfort
I visit as they rebuild the house
from within whitening straightening
bracing the chimneybreast edges
and forcing warmth dryness
and windows with views into
the cottage below canallevel
For yes theres a canal bringing
cold reflections almost to the door
and beyond it the main line to Manchester
its grid of gantries pale
against the upland and the sky
theres a towpath pub where the red
haired old landlady
brings up the beer from the cellar slowly
in a jug theres a chapel
next door to the cottage set up
with a false front and a real
boilerhouse and
rest my mindnearby theres
a small haulage contractors yard
Everythings turned up here except
a certain complete castiron
housefront preserved and pinned
to a blank wall in Ottawa
This comfort
beckons It wont do It beckons
Driving steadily through rain in
a watertight car with the wipers going
It wont do It beckons
Ive lived within half a mile of it
for twenty years West
by the black iron weatherhen
halfstrangled with clematis
on the garage roof
I can locate it Past a low ridge
in the cliff face of a limestone dale
theres a cave in the bushes
When the old tigers
were long since gone leaving their
teeth the valley people
would climb there with the dead
they thought most useful
push them well in
take them out again
walk them around
Theyre coming Theyre coming
            We Malagasies love            our second burials            We hire a band that comes            in a van Again            with liquefaction almost done            we hold our cherished ones            in our arms From the graveclothes            they fall in gobbets as dogfood            falls from the can We wrap them            in fresh dry linen They            bless our lives with their happiness
Walk them around the valley Drop
here a finger
for the god that is a rat or a raven
here a metatarsal
to set under the hearth for luck
And what was luck
The afterlife back then
was fairly long
nothing demented like for ever
nothing military The afterlife
would come to the party
Even if you didnt have green eyes in the bathtub blue
Even if you didnt have a lovely singing voice
            or care for Alexandrine champagne
            some slow Saturday evenings to sing it through
it pleases me your lips close to my ear
            or when youre a big girl and Im a big girl too
Five years difference between we two
Sometimes it hardly matters Ive decided to worship you
            Diana goddess of the forest
            or is she the one of the hunt
            Who cares You remind me of her
too Some woman caught me up breathless in her strong arms
            said breathe darling Her eyes were greenblue
Vague resemblances thats the daily news
Meaning Im willingly a fool for you
            any hour past midnight
            and almost anytime in threequarter view
            Consider this too stumbling back after a fight
to someplace we could call home you and I have been known
            to duet a jubilee so funky it sounds like the blues
What steady arrows you shoot Diana become
a goddess of the hearth you whisper
            time to put the porchlight on            and we do Who am I talking to
What is this strange glare this prescience that you wont be true
Sometimes you say something like even so boo
and it sounds like breathe darling Thats why this ones for you
All my stories are about being left
all yours about leaving So we should have known
Should have known to leave well enough alone
we knew and we didnt You said lets put
our cards on the table your card
was your body the table my bed where we didnt
get till 4 am so tired from wanting
what we shouldnt that when we finally found our heads
wed lost our minds Love I wanted to call you
so fast But so slow you could taste each
letter licked into your particular and roselike earL love for lets wait O for oh no lets not V
for the precious v between your deep breasts
and the virtue of your fingers
in the voluptuous center of me
Okay E for enough
Dawn broke or shattered Once weve made
the promises its hard to add the prefix if   
But not so wrong to try
That means taking a lot of walks
which neither of us is good at
for different reasons and nights up till 2
arguing whose reasons are better
Time and numbers count a lot in this 13
years my marriage 5 years you my friend
4th of July weekend when something that begins
in mist by mistake whose means too much
has to end I think we need an abacus to get our love
on course and one of us to oil the shining rods
so we can keep the crazy beads clicking
clicking It wasnt a question
of a perfect fit Theoretically
it should be enough to say I left a man
for a woman 90 of the world is content
to leave it at that Oh lazy world and when the woman
lost her nerve I left
for greater concerns when words like autonomy
were useful I used them I confess So I get
what I deserve a studio apartment he paid the rent on
bookshelves up to the ceiling she drove
the screws for And a skylight I sleep alone
beneath and two shiny quarters in my pocket
to call one then the other or to call one
twice Once twice I threatened to leave him
remember Now that Ive done it he says
he doesnt Im in a phonebooth at the corner of Bank
and Greenwich not a booth exactly
but two sheets of glass to shiver between
This is called being streetsmart dialing
a number that you know wont be answered
but the message you leave leaves proof that you tried
And this my two dearly beloveds is this called
hedging your bets I fish out my other
coin turn it over in my fingers press
it into the slot Hold it there Let it drop
Ill take a bath when it snows
when I can look out the window up high
and see the sky all pale
and blank like a fishs eye
And I know the boats wont go out tonight
the fishermen drinking whiskey locked
in a bardream the music rocking them deeper
It doesnt snow enough here
though some would say otherwise
fearing accidents But the paper boy skidding
uphill on his bike in light snow knows better
making Stracks when his wheels slide sideways
We really needed this snow the old men will say
putting to bed the surface roots of trees
putting to bed the tootravelled streets
When everything is covered
the earth has a light of its own
the snow falls down from the moon
as everyone knows and brings that light
back to us I needed this light
All day I kept by the window watching the sky
a prisoner in my clothes the wind felt dry
and mean Starlings stalked the yard with evil eyes
I hated them and hated too my neighbors house
where sparks from the chimney fell back in a stinking
cloudblack ashes bringing no blessing
When the roads are covered
when the water is black and snow falls
into the waves the birds hunger swirls
the air dark lovely shapes All hungers
are equal now Ill give them bread and seeds
I have no money the whiskey is gone
and I must bathe in water Fishermen please
do not go out in your flimsy boats tonight
to chase after the cod and mackerel
to hook the giant eels Go safe
go free Let your feet leave trails
through streets and yards wandering
home your crooked voyages to bed
New houses relax on the fields
Garage doors open soundlessly
to admit the monster Tires stretched
over forty pounds of air
pressure float across gravel
The boy closes the last storm
door on the last evening
paper and runs to the car
where his mother waits She does not
answer him the door slam freezes
her dreams It is January
A dog chained to a barn door
keeps barking Somebodys angry
scared to let him go
On the other side
of a forest past these fields
wolves sniff the hard snow
of the tundra I lay beside the only
tree for warmth there
where the pack might find me
The house takes care of us now
Look at the meat
browning under the light
The refrigerator switches on
ice crashes into the tray
Here are locks in case someone
wants to do us harm Remember
how the police had to pound and pound
to wake us that night a white Cadillac
leapt from the icy road
into the arms of our maple It hung there
empty doors flung wide
it was a great white petal of a car
breathing under the gaslights opening
and opening
for Janet and Christopher
     Halfeagle halflion the fabulous
          animal struts saberclawed but saintly
   a candlewicked ornament dangling
from our rickety sugar pine Butternut
     pudding in our bellies His reindeer
          and sleigh hurried here and gonethank God
     for us childless folks Almost   the lovelocked
Griffins on the sofa sockfooted hearing
     gas and a kiddy heart in her tummy
          a life more imaginary than real
     though one is dazzled by gold that fills
the egg unbroken We feed her crumpets
     and listen again The lambs a hungry
          bugger even snug from earths
     imponderable fury Tomorrow in a spurt
by jet Im home Clumsy as a puppy
     Ill scale the flightstairs into the nosecone
          luggage banging at my sides enter the egg
     shaped cabin and await the infrared
climb toward space Tell me one
     thing true If I could count the way
          things slip from us Mothers fur gloves
     Sundays benediction the dead gone before us
loves rambler on the prairieall displaced
     as we buckle in our shuttle
          jetbound on a screaming runway
     gravity pulling at us castaways
more mammal than bird subtle
     legweary griffins made manifest
          arrowing towards home How do we
     ignore it the attenuated being
of our age the bittersweet collapse
     of dominoes mooned around our pine
           Withered with hatred from his quarter
     Saint Stephen even at death rolled mercifully over
in high holiness Sonless wifeless nine
     thousand feet from land I roll the lozenge
          on my tongue youthful habit for ache
     of any kind parting a survivor Wait
love rescuing me from the fringe
Dusty and treeless the street sloped beneath us
Somewhere a hammer made thunderclaps
forging the nightsky
                                       Then the children
seeing us dashed from the Moorish houses
vigorously shouting vying for position
while the bravest
in worn underpants and plastic sandals
climbed a high craterlike wall
and plunged with murderous cries
into the Roman pool
where bluelipped fish waited
Ah those glorious soaked heads spiked like palm fronds
Seeing one in our group clutch her purse
repelled by the wet black princes
who shivered in circles of yellow mud
and begged from us
I felt ashamed
In the brief African twilight
a canary chirped something
shrewdly about avarice
Far off in the little neighborhood
where I grewwith neat cement walkways
and crabapple blossoms
money ran through the fingers
of our house with nothing much
to record its loss but unhappiness
one of us ironing servilely
one of us sobbing in a bedroom
one of us sleeping on a rifle
one of us seizing another by the hair
demanding the animallike submission
we thought was love
                                       Sunday evening
Mother is wearing a big cotton shift
and tweezing her eyebrows
Her head is a thicket of hairpins
In the round handmirror
that parodies her face
the world looks greater than it is
I am next to bathe in the water
of the poor earth reused by each of us
in order of birth Gray with sodium and grit
it covers me like a black robe
and yet I feel exalted
                                       Soon the violent rain
like wet Sahara sand would fall
scrubbing the hot labyrinthine
corridors of shuttered houses and aimless dogs
where the sparse life is
purgative and inexhaustible
where little pilfering hands
moved freely in and out
of my trouser pockets
though there were no diamonds
except those the eyes mined
The heat out there this evening
is contained heat like things keep applicable boxes
at the ready then subsume their diverging constituent parts
long ambivalent talks into midnight all those
glowy Sophia Coppola movies Prosecco
the sexiest records I know I dont feel
how I know anymore to be more than something seeking
my appalling lack of cinematic knowledge fictive innocence
 something like the breakdown of those little boxes
little tombs put their hands up in front of my mouth
theres a tacitly humiliating eulogy to drown out couldnt feel
much more stupid about feeling stupid over feeling
stupid living Let me go  watch something
moving several images some of them symbolize humility broken
postures bloodshot eyes intimately talking through this
publicly I am not developing at all but just the same So hot
outside in the evening heat locking hazy jonquils
 sunflowers dead for two weeks ridiculously
mournful as Ill try  dimly think of the last real shock
I remember disgust perhaps  something like alarm the phone
going off in the middle of the night pervasive disappointment
 for sure horror but shock as if the heat were seceding from the frames
of its containment thought  feeling  establishing some wonderama
ratios  beanpole features quick to surge beyond the human model
I know I do the heat out there this evening
will  maybe I should be the one I know who has to stop
If I have to heal myself completely every time before I start
I shouldnt be I think about the god of demurrment in the world
or I think about it later having fallen to its love spell  the heat
keeps me shut up at the table in the evening
at the laptop arranging each letter with the same affectless love
its nothing moving Avery born  Vivian to come December
Kermit the Frog sings the Ave Maria while the white flag is endlessly
lowered  raised through the whole masterslave dialectic forever
Dont let me be wistful Let me be the actual heat forgiven
its severity  leaving for the year Mercy is just like the childrens zoo its real
weird to think about anything now think how fucking hard
a fucking beach read used to be sewn into its spine
delicious words from start to finish I could just
lay there  die its so goddamn nice in this sigh vitrine real 911
kind of midnight Friday midnight lamely shifting in my chair the fan
that stops the love that moves the world that stops goes out on gold
weeks other weeks it just sits in the back
It collects statically I hate that
for Brandon Goacher
I
Let me speak with expressive
hesitation  a feeling for
interment why even
lineate what isnt broken by
music let me speak with
inextricable reluctance
I want to tear the heart
from refused convalescence
 feed it those long fronds
of river bed grass I want to
tear the heart out of style
 put it between
utter thrall  the infancy
of all things impure
Torn out a flame thickens
between us as if
not right now well be
ripped from this life
or each other a white
lie not a little more tender
than quick Inextricable
reluctance to die or even
leave youth culture ever
What a stupid feeling
Do you think it isnt
true The very existence
of flame throwers proves
that sometime somewhere
someone said to themselves
You know I want to
set those people over there
on fire but Im just not
close enough to get the
job done Someone
puts their arms around you
in the cold Theres an al
most disquieting closeness
as gossamer clots 
becomes an impasto derivative
of some newly visible
interdependence Flame
throwers then are just
a description of prevailing
ideology relics the life
of the party a soul
flirts by burning
that name for itself
up in jonesing that comes
at the end of desire
Well I wouldnt know
about that A little
goat Why would it
nuzzle dreamily up
the way I nuzzle dreamily
up to my knees In the
fatal position as my
nephew used to call it
estranged from play
waiting on the fox hunt
Oh baby
it beats up my lips
the somatic effects
of contriving a psychic
blockade against death
with the contours of your
face  healing
in constant eclipse
where all things
inextricably broken by
music make the basic
rhythmic unit go
something like this  I
dont want to loose you I
dont want to be
empty clever hold 
keep you I was lost
 to you to start with still
 I keep on coming back
Do you think youll
keep on coming back to me
forever Thats the meaning
 of our life together
 baby

the ideal city building itself in his brain
Is this mile magnificent Hes lived here
a while but the mile feels unreal Robinsons
training himself to act blasé Do museums
amuse me Yes but not today Would he
like to be in one Of course Why not
An object of value with canvas wings
an unchanging face in a gilt frame arranged
thoughtless guiltfree  preserved
for eternity Robinson doesnt want to be
exceptional He knows he is He wants to beperceived exceptional Trains plunge by steam 
rising from the grates Sing muse of a man
illmet at the Met A man on his lunch break 
heading for a heartbreak a breakup with Time
A breakup with time Feeling filled with ice 
the way you chill a glass Robinson passes
the National Academy He craves a sense 
of belonging not to always be longing To be
standing in a doorway incredibly kissable 
not waiting at the fourway eminently missable
Is this mile magnanimous He wants it 
unanimous that this is his kind of town
up  down  including Brooklyn The sky 
is clearing but the isolation sticks
Robinsons not sure what a camera obscura 
is for but he thinks he should have
his portrait done with one Faces 
blur by as he heads toward the Frick
Something used to photograph the obscure
O littleknow factshow Robinson attracts them 
Pilgrims rocked ashore here before Plymouth Rock 
The word scrimshaw is of unknown origin 
The stock name of the archaic twolane main road Route 6A Really
its Old Kings Highway 
Some facts are useless the paper bag was invented in Dennis 
Some facts are not Wellfleets town clock sings out ships time 
19th century Americans observed only three holidays The Fourth of
July was one 
O witty aperçushow Robinson accrues them 
Good food is selfmade like a good millionaire 
Dont just do something Stand there 
Its got to be the weekend somewhere 
Robinson is crisp  perspicuous His wife stands next to him on the
sand 
Democracy could be a lot more sexy if    this one fades in the rockets
red glare 
Ann blushes runs a hand through his hair 
Robinson looks up concussed 
Fireworks percuss
the Tuesday after he was last seen 
A policeman is there to pick the shrill thing up Who is it the couple of friends present ask as he cups it to his ear 
Then hangs up There was no one there 
They have come to recon a vacant propertya mise en scéne 
Knoll butterfly chairsa pair of them
two red socks soaking in the white bathroom sink
a saucer of milk for the cat to drink
a stack of reeltoreel tapes
a matchbook from the Italian Village where he ate his last spaghetti
dinner
 two books hed been rereading or wanted someone to think he
had
 The Devils  The Tragic Sense of Life 
Preoccupation  a certain mode of selfpresentation 
Even when absent Robinson has a style 
No wallet though No watch no sleeping bag no bankbook 
The apartment looks the way it feels to read a newspaper thats one
day old 
The policeman wants to go back outside among the lemons  fog 
barking dogs 
Out where the sun can copper their faces 
Writing takes space recordings take time 
The place puts the policeman in mind of something he read recently
about the collapse of a dead star 
About how it takes ages for the light to become motionless 
Seven years after a disappearance a person can be pronounced dead 
But thats nothing compared to the size of the ocean

Living from pill to pill from bed to couch
what doesnt kill me only makes me dizzy
Pain dissolves like chalk in water
grit on the bottom of the glass
Waiting takes forever
throbs to the soles of my feet Bella noche   
Hives as large as mice hump up under my skin
no more barbiturates for you Cynthia
itch stretch I dont fit my flesh
sting tingle prick the sorcerers threat
Theres a knife stabbed through my left eye
My right foot is made of elephant hide
and weighs in at roughly one cartload of potatoes
Oxygen twentyfour hours Im swelled with steroids
prednisone buzz in the brain a motel room
with sixteen foreign workers sleeping in shifts
playing reggae at three am
2
Oh I love my white pill
that makes the black fist of pain unclench
unspasming the nerves I float
released to darkness visible
worlds dissolving
And the yellow pill bitter on my tongue
that wakes me at 2 am
writing out plans in Arabic
to organize an expedition to the Pole
Drug of hubris searing my eyes
my scrawl unreadable in daylight foil my enemies
Bitter taste of fugue
my hand shakes some foreign being in my brain giving orders
You must You must You will
Later the pungent brown liquor
shoots the dark with threads of gold behind my eyes
One flash as the mind goes out
3
I must elude pain
                                                            float past clarity
pain in the brain
                                                            slammed down like a housefly
Its a big dodge
Fly on a stovetop
                                                            sizzle and ash pop
This is illusion
                                                                        mental confusion
                                                            born in the synapse
What can be undone
                                                            down to the last gasp
Its a hodgepodge
If you kill pain
                                                you will become pain
pain does not feel pain
                                                            no nerves in the brain
Its a mindfuck
Its just your bad luck
                                                            A torpor sealed my brain
                                                            I felt no humans near
                                                            it seemed to me I could not feel
                                                            or touch or see or hear
I dont know who I am
                                                            without my medicine
My skin will crawl with bugs
                                                            if I dont get my drugs
My brains a maelstrom
                                                            singing a sad song
Reality is so cruel
Prednisone oh prednisone
so fast my mind racing never tasting
rest
Razzledazzle razz
Fist bitch piss stitch witch   
                                                            only wait the fit will pass
fast gash lash splashQUIT
I saw a werewolf in a white suit walking
past the tables at the Full Moon Café
Floppy bow tie big furry hands
Percodan Percocet let you go let you rest
When the grip lets you go and you float like a note
on the flow theres your life theres no worry
yeah its funky how the night moves
Barbiturate babykins narcotic slut
black oil of opiate Chatty Cathy dirty brat
bedwetter nasty pants
Painkiller painkiller I have a new friend
better than my old friend
plugging holes in the brain
Sigmund Freud Sigmund Freud Sigmund Freud Cocaine
I want a soft landing let me float
Once the seizure lifted me and threw me down
I did not like it I did not like lying there
on the floor looking up
through air like green water
4
And there is one so dark a ghost
it passes through the mesh of thought
without tearing a strand whispering
destinies perceived true pronouncing
sentences of death
5
A cloud the absence of a noun no name
roaring far away in the summer
dark like a train or a giant fan or a highway that never stops
The mind explodes in the dark of space
unnursed by atmospheres
as air raid sirens scream for blood
and I am only nerves strung on constellations
meridians and vectors quivering A red and yellow
capsule invades the chemistry of thought cathode rays blast
from the television screen and signals pass deep into space
until the stars are singing Rosalita You
will not remember this night
                                               So why dont you sleep with girls
                                               Im not really attracted to girls
                                               Are you telling me you were really
                                               attracted to every man you slept with
                                                                        Conversation with a friend
1
After twenty I stopped counting
not like my friend Beverly who sewed
an embroidered satin star on her bellbottoms
for every new guy she fucked
She had them running down both legs
and around the billowing hem
and was starting up the inseam
when the jeans gave out in the wash
It was a boys game anyway those years
of our extended homage to the penis
the guitar playing the penis drums saluting it
cock rock Molotov cocktail the motorcycle
gripped between the thighs and I went down
we all went down in the old cultural disaster
of idol worshipa thousandyear bender
Only this time it was the adolescent member
oiled and laved thrust forward arcing
thin with ache all tight flesh poked upward
claiming its own How it came and went
penetrating but never settling down
and how often we were caused to admire it
hairless sweet warrior raider against the State
But I have this sweet pink flower
here between my legsI put my hand down and touch it
still soft and wet and manyfolded endlessly opening
hiding seeking hidden and sought
but never very much admired or even smiled on
in those years never served much less sung to
Not a garden then but a citadel
a wall to be breached a new land claimed
but linger there No I would say
there was an overall lack of appreciation
though breasts were well respected slopping loose
under Tshirts like little animals
and I would feel my nipples brush the cotton
with pleasure see them regarded also with pleasure
Still sex then was a taking like spoils of war a victory
over all those straight fucks back home marooned
in the dismal suburbs that birthed us squalling and red
and watched us flee in ungrateful cars down night highways
And God knows it felt good those nights
I was ready it was ready to open and answer the call
And take me down and roll me over yes and give
it to mebut why all this riding away afterward
Where was everyone going
and why didnt I get to ride along Who knew at first
nothing had changed just wanting the thrust and tug
and slam up against the headboard I should say so
but left still wanting more wanting to leap
out of centuries shame and be something new
not this old consolation of women for the powerless
some kind of cosmic door prize awarded
just for showing up with a dick
some proof to themselves these boys were men
Youre good he said Hell I wasnt taking a typing test
I was fighting to live in a dying world
I was throwing myself away an offering to wildest space
surrender to the minds dissolve the bodys electric light
nerve endings firing like exploding stars
Youre good they all said
youd think somebody was doing a survey
Girls say yes to boys who say no and then
your professor asks if youre wearing underwear
when you meet for your conference on the poetry of Yeats
Crossing the border after midnight in a borrowed car
after a visit to the afterhours doctors office in Sarnia
Nodding out in the back seat pills wearing off
He was a legend among undergraduates
cheap and reliable always on call
until a month later the headlines screamed
Abortion Doc when a girl died in his office
and he dragged her down to the river
and dumped her body in the underbrush
Heart oh heart
I sit here writing your name
on pieces of paper
folded hidden misplaced   
found again
There is the element of saying
and there is the element of making
one neednt choose
I am singing the dream out from the ice
asking it to carry me
like a horse or a river down and away
This day here in panedglass sun
the young waitress shaking out her apron
and retying it flat across her stomach
a bit of vanityher hair swept off her neck
crash of a milk bottle
on the granite counter cream
spread in a mild pool toward the rim
and the roots of habit and longing
briefly seized by the mind
So noisy here The sound echoes
out of years brought to this
showing forth unrehearsed
It seems we wake
and find ourselves repeating
embodying the ancient gestures
by which we recognize
ourselves completed
Not one of us could be born
and invent lifeit must show through us
the arm flung in the air the coffee poured out
and down the street someone hurrying by
head down against the wind
And a man and a woman
come to an old grief
carved in them carved
into them
the old way of water wearing rock
by law and the hatred
between them is equal
to the hope neither will release
Each wants to be whole
to embody all of time when nothing
in this world is whole and
this is by law
When my father said bitterly
to my mother you have changed
he meant without meaning to say
how she had changed him A man
holds his head down against the wind
Yet the wind fills him
with the dust of temples
the breath of the dead
The dream of the light
inside the branches
a gleam of wet glimmer that is a bud
the leaf within the bud
The photographer comes inside
and closes the lens of his camera
Then he is the lens Then my eye
is the light This
is the element of saying
The young waitress flings a paper cup
behind her into the trash can
That is a saying The cream swirled
into the coffee the sugar
dissolving disembodied
and the body of the manager disappears
swallowed into a doorway
The element of making is slow
uncertain as a temple
a falling forward stitching back
like a stone wall like the panes in an
arched window like a repetition
chosen beyond necessity
Yet somehow we have seen all this before
the girl in the fur hat
speaking syrup into a phone
the falseness of her charm
is an ancient imposter familiar and
therefore true
A door is opened and falls
closed Suddenly at every table
someone looks down and is reading
books newspapers calendars
reading tea leaves reading bones
A woman in a periwinkle jacket I am reading
her shoulders as the day introspects
In dream the passive construction
and the past perfect tense prevailshe was being pushed on a swing
The woman with many television credits
gazes out the window heavy with years
forgetting herself forgetting sorrow
the false husband the crippled child
the old plots forgetting 
and it is suddenly lovely as free as
something read or dreamed the young
waitress with sun on her
faceher unblemished facelooks up
from the middle of eternity her desire
immaculate in the moment 
When a word is beautiful
above all othersyour name
when a woman appears as a bird of prey
and we turn away
hoping not to be recognizedoh heart
when the light on the branches
flares in a window with no sky
this is old story reading us these are springs
from words laid down before
and ahead of us and in the moment
we are making an answer
for E
               I stop my hand midair
               If I touch her there everything about me will be true
               The New World discovered without pick or ax
               I will be what Brenda Jones was stoned for in 1969
               I saw it as a girl but didnt know I was taking in myself
               My hand remembers treading the watery room
               just behind the roseveiled eyes of memory
Alone in the yard tucked beneath the hood of her car
lucky clover all about her feet green teasweet necklace
for her mudpie crusty work boots
She fends off their spit  words with silent twohanded
twists  turns of her socket wrench A hurl of sticks 
stones and only me to whisper for her from sidewalk far
 break my bones A grown woman in greasepocket overalls
inside her own sexy transmission despite the crowding of
hurled red hots Beneath the hood of her candyapple Camaro 
souped shiny low to the ground 
               The stars over the Atlantic are dangling
               salt crystals The room at the Seashell Inn is
               20 a night special winter offseason rate
               No one else here but us and the night clerk
               five floors below alone with his cherished
               stack of Spiderman My lips are red snails
               in a primal search for every constellation
               hiding in the sky of your body My hand
               waits for permission for my life to agree
               to be changed forever Can Captain Night
               Clerk hear my fingers tambourining you
               there on the moon Wont he soon climb
               the stairs and bam on the hood of this car
               You are a woman with film reels for eyes
               Years of long talking have brought us to the
               land of the body Our skin is one endless
               prayer bead of brown If my hand ever lands
               I will fly past dreaming Australian Aborigines
               The old claw hammer and monkey wrench
               that flew at Brenda Jones will fly across the
               yard of ocean at me A grease rag will be
               thrust into my painters pants against my
               will I will never be able to wash or peel
               any of this away Before the night is over
               someone I do not know will want the keys
               to my 55 silver Thunderbird He will chase
               me down the street A gaggle of spooked
               hens will fly up in my grandmothers yard
               never to lay another egg just as I am jump
               ed kneed pulled finally to the high ground
               of sweet clover
            I want to tell you ladies and gentlemen theres not enough
            troops in the army to force the southern people to break
            down segregation and accept the Negro pronounced Nigra

of nosy paramours strolling churlish penny
pinchers pour onto the mansion estate Below
Strom Thurmond is dancing with my mother
The favorite son of South Carolina has already
danced with the giddy bride and the giddy brides
mother More women await Easter dressy
drenched in caramel double exposed triple cinched
lined up leggy ready
I refuse to leave the porch
If I walk down I imagine he will extend his
hand assume I am next in his happy darky line
427 on his dance card His history
and mine burnt cork and blackboard chalk
concentric pancaked one face two histories
slow dragging doing the nasty
My father knows all this
Daddys Black Chief Justice legs straddle the boilerplate
carapace of the CSS H L Hunley lost Confederate
submarine soon to be found just off the coast of
Charleston He keeps it fully submerged by
applying the weight of every treatise he has
ever written against the death penalty of
South Carolina Chanting Briggs v Elliott
he keeps the ironside door of the submarine shut
No hands
His eyes are a Black fathers beacon search
lights blazing for the marriedoff sons and
on the unmarried whaleeyed noseinbook
daughter born unmoored quiet yellow
strategically placed under hospital lights to
fully bake The one with the most to lose
There will be no trouble Still he chain
smokes A burning stick of mint  Indian
leaf seesaws between his lips He wants
me to remember that trouble is a fire that
runs like a staircase up then down Even
on a beautiful day in June
I remember the new research just out
What the Negro gave America
Chapter 9206
 Enslaved Africans gifted porches to NorthAmerica Once off the boats they were toldthen made to build themselves a placeto live 
They build the house that will keep them alive
Rather than be the bloody human floret on
yet another southern tree they imagine higher
ground They build landings with floor enough
to see the trouble coming Their arced imaginations
nail the necessary out into the floral air On the
backs and fronts of twentypenny houses
a watching place is made for the ones who will
come tipping with torch  hog tie through the
quiet woods hoping to hang them as decoration
in the porcupine hair of longleaf
The architecture of Black people is sui generis
This is architecture dreamed by the enslaved
Their design will be stolen
Their wits will outlast gold
My eyes seek historical rest from the kiss
kiss theater below Strom Thurmonds
itsnevertoolatetoforgiveme chivaree
I search the tops of yellow pine while my
fingers reach catch pinch my fathers
determinedtorise smoke
Long before AC African people did the
math how to cool down the hot air of
South Carolina
If I could descend without being trotted
out by some roughrider driven by his
submarine dreams this is what Id take
my time and scribble into the threetiered
white créme wedding cake
 Filibuster States Rights The Grand Inquisitionof the great Thurgood Marshall This weddingreception would not have been possible withoutthe Civil Rights Act of 1957 opposed byyouknowwho 
The Dixiecrat senator has not worn his
sandy seersucker fedora to the vows
The top of Strom Thurmonds bald head
reveals a birthmark tattooed in contrapposto
pose Segregation Forever
All my life he has been the face of hatred
the blue eyes of the Confederate flag
the pasty bald of white men pulling wooly
heads up into the dark skirts of trees
the sharp slobbering amber teeth of
German shepherds still clenched inside
the tissuethin still marching bandleader
legs of Black schoolteachers the single
minded pupae growing between the legs of
white boys crossing the tracks ready to
force Black girls into fifthgrade positions

I didnt want to dance with him
My young cousin arrives at my elbow
Her beautiful lips the color of softskin
mangoes She pulls teasing the stitches
of my satin bridesmaid gown You better
go on down there and dance with Strom
while he still has something left
I dont tell her it is unsouthern for her
to call him by his first name as if they
are familiar I dont tell her To bear
witness to marriage is to believe that
everything moving through the sweet
wedding air can be confidently left
to Love
I stand on the landing high above the
beginnings of Love holding a plastic
champagne flute drinking in the warm
June air of South Carolina I hear my
youngest brothers top hat joy Looking
down I find him deep in the giddy crowd
modern integrated interpretive
For ten seconds I consider dancing with
Strom His Confederate hands touch
every shoulder finger back that I love
I listen to the sound of Black laughter
shimmying All worry floats beyond
the gurgling submarine bubbles
the white railing every drop of
champagne air
I close my eyes and Uncle Freddie
appears out of a babys breath of fog
The dead are never porch bound
He moves with ease where I cannot
He walks out on the ricethrown air
heaving a lightning bolt instead of
a wave Suddenly there is a table set
complete with 1963 dining room stars
they twinkle twinkle up  behind him
Thelonious Martin Malcolm Nina
Dakota all mouths Negro wide 
open have come to sing me down
His tattered almanac sleeps curled like
a wintering slug in his back pocket
His dark Dogon eyes jet to the scene
below then zoom past me until they are
lost in the waning sugilite sky Turning
in the shadows of the wheat fields
he whispers a truth plucked from
the foreword tucked in his back pocketVeritas Black people will forgive you
quicker than you can say OrangeburgMassacre 
History does not keep books on the
handiwork of slaves But the enslaved
who built this Big House long before
I arrived for this big wedding knew
the power of a porch
This native necessity of nailing down
a place for the cooling off of air
in order to lift the friendly the kindly
the so politely the inlovely jubilant
into the arms of the grand peculiar
for the greater good of
the public spectacular

All I could see from where I stood Was three long mountains and a wood I turned and looked another way And saw three islands in a bay So with my eyes I traced the line  Of the horizon thin and fine Straight around till I was come Back to where Id started from  And all I saw from where I stood Was three long mountains and a wood   Over these things I could not see These were the things that bounded me And I could touch them with my hand Almost I thought from where I stand And all at once things seemed so small My breath came short and scarce at all   But sure the sky is big I said Miles and miles above my head So here upon my back Ill lie And look my fill into the sky And so I looked and after all The sky was not so very tall The sky I said must somewhere stop Andsure enoughI see the top  The sky I thought is not so grand I most could touch it with my hand And reaching up my hand to try I screamed to feel it touch the sky   I screamed andloInfinity Came down and settled over me Forced back my scream into my chest Bent back my arm upon my breast And pressing of the Undefined The definition on my mind Held up before my eyes a glass Through which my shrinking sight did pass Until it seemed I must behold Immensity made manifold Whispered to me a word whose sound Deafened the air for worlds around And brought unmuffled to my ears The gossiping of friendly spheres The creaking of the tented sky The ticking of Eternity   I saw and heard and knew at last The How and Why of all things past And present and forevermore The Universe cleft to the core Lay open to my probing sense That sickning I would fain pluck thence But could notnay But needs must suck At the great wound and could not pluck My lips away till I had drawn All venom outAh fearful pawn For my omniscience paid I toll In infinite remorse of soul   All sin was of my sinning all Atoning mine and mine the gall Of all regret Mine was the weight  Of every brooded wrong the hate That stood behind each envious thrust Mine every greed mine every lust   And all the while for every grief Each suffering I craved relief With individual desire Craved all in vain And felt fierce fire About a thousand people crawl Perished with eachthen mourned for all   A man was starving in Capri He moved his eyes and looked at me I felt his gaze I heard his moan And knew his hunger as my own I saw at sea a great fog bank Between two ships that struck and sank A thousand screams the heavens smote And every scream tore through my throat   No hurt I did not feel no death That was not mine mine each last breath That crying met an answering cry From the compassion that was I All suffering mine and mine its rod Mine pity like the pity of God   Ah awful weight Infinity Pressed down upon the finite Me My anguished spirit like a bird Beating against my lips I heard Yet lay the weight so close about There was no room for it without And so beneath the weight lay I And suffered death but could not die   Long had I lain thus craving death When quietly the earth beneath Gave way and inch by inch so great At last had grown the crushing weight Into the earth I sank till I Full six feet under ground did lie And sank no morethere is no weight Can follow here however great From off my breast I felt it roll And as it went my tortured soul Burst forth and fled in such a gust That all about me swirled the dust   Deep in the earth I rested now Cool is its hand upon the brow And soft its breast beneath the head Of one who is so gladly dead And all at once and over all The pitying rain began to fall I lay and heard each pattering hoof Upon my lowly thatched roof And seemed to love the sound far more Than ever I had done before For rain it hath a friendly sound To one whos six feet underground And scarce the friendly voice or face A grave is such a quiet place   The rain I said is kind to come And speak to me in my new home I would I were alive again To kiss the fingers of the rain To drink into my eyes the shine Of every slanting silver line To catch the freshened fragrant breeze From drenched and dripping appletrees For soon the shower will be done And then the broad face of the sun Will laugh above the rainsoaked earth Until the world with answering mirth Shakes joyously and each round drop Rolls twinkling from its grassblade top   How can I bear it buried here While overhead the sky grows clear And blue again after the storm O multicolored multiform Beloved beauty over me That I shall never never see Again Springsilver autumngold That I shall never more behold Sleeping your myriad magics through Closesepulchred away from you O God I cried give me new birth And put me back upon the earth Upset each clouds gigantic gourd And let the heavy rain downpoured In one big torrent set me free Washing my grave away from me   I ceased and through the breathless hush That answered me the faroff rush Of herald wings came whispering Like music down the vibrant string Of my ascending prayer andcrash Before the wild winds whistling lash The startled stormclouds reared on high And plunged in terror down the sky And the big rain in one black wave Fell from the sky and struck my grave   I know not how such things can be I only know there came to me A fragrance such as never clings To aught save happy living things A sound as of some joyous elf Singing sweet songs to please himself And through and over everything A sense of glad awakening The grass atiptoe at my ear Whispering to me I could hear I felt the rains cool fingertips Brushed tenderly across my lips Laid gently on my sealed sight And all at once the heavy night Fell from my eyes and I could see A drenched and dripping appletree A last long line of silver rain A sky grown clear and blue again And as I looked a quickening gust Of wind blew up to me and thrust Into my face a miracle Of orchardbreath and with the smell I know not how such things can be I breathed my soul back into me   Ah Up then from the ground sprang I And hailed the earth with such a cry As is not heard save from a man Who has been dead and lives again About the trees my arms I wound   Like one gone mad I hugged the ground I raised my quivering arms on high I laughed and laughed into the sky Till at my throat a strangling sob Caught fiercely and a great heartthrob Sent instant tears into my eyes O God I cried no dark disguise Can eer hereafter hide from me Thy radiant identity   Thou canst not move across the grass But my quick eyes will see Thee pass Nor speak however silently But my hushed voice will answer Thee I know the path that tells Thy way Through the cool eve of every day God I can push the grass apart And lay my finger on Thy heart   The world stands out on either side No wider than the heart is wide Above the world is stretched the sky No higher than the soul is high The heart can push the sea and land Farther away on either hand The soul can split the sky in two And let the face of God shine through But East and West will pinch the heart That can not keep them pushed apart And he whose soul is flatthe sky Will cave in on him by and by   
I like to see it lap the Miles 
And lick the Valleys up  
And stop to feed itself at Tanks  
And then  prodigious step
Around a Pile of Mountains  
And supercilious peer
In Shanties  by the sides of Roads  
And then a Quarry pare
To fit its sides
And crawl between
Complaining all the while
In horrid  hooting stanza  
Then chase itself down Hill  
And neigh like Boanerges  
Then  prompter than a Star
Stop  docile and omnipotent
At its own stable door  
I move my hands
in these woods
to find her sexparts
We discover our sexparts
make heat
and blue light
We become outlines of ourselves
long scratches
in the sky
We have a daughter
who was never born
She lives in the house
we never built
but in this new light
you can almost see
its tattered roof
Inside the woods is an abandoned hotel
Trees grow in the lobby
and up through the rooms
Limbs jut out through the windows
It looks like outside
inside
I climb the trees
through 1000 rooms
I look for you
in each of them
Youre a long shiny line
There are trees and they are on fire There are hummingbirds and they are on fire There are graves and they are on fire and the things coming out of the graves are on fire The house you grew up in is on fire There is a gigantic trebuchet on fire on the edge of a crater and the crater is on fire There is a complex system of tunnels deep underneath the surface with only one entrance and one exit and the entire system is filled with fire There is a wooden cage were trapped in too large to see and it is on fire There are jaguars on fire Wolves Spiders Wolfspiders on fire If there were people If our fathers were alive If we had a daughter Fire to the edges Fire in the river beds Fire between the mattresses of the bed you were born in Fire in your mothers belly There is a little boy wearing a fire shirt holding a baby lamb There is a little girl in a fire skirt asking if she can ride the baby lamb like a horse There is you on top of me with thighs of fire while a hot red fog hovers in your hair There is me on top of you wearing a fire shirt and then pulling the fire shirt over my head and tossing it like a fireball through the fog at a new kind of dinosaur There are meteorites disintegrating in the atmosphere just a few thousand feet above us and tiny fireballs are falling down around us pooling around us forming a kind of fire lake which then forms a kind of fire cloud There is this feeling I get when I am with you There is our future house burning like a star on the hill There is our dark flickering shadow There is my hand on fire in your hand on fire my body on fire above your body on fire our tongues made of ash We are rocks on a distant and uninhabitable planet We have our whole life ahead of us
Someone once told me that animals are people under spells and if you fall in love with them the spell will be lifted I recently fell in love with a black trumpeter swan I watched her ruffle her neck feathers for hours watched her peck bugs from her breast I was sure she would make a beautiful bride but she was always a black trumpeter swan I once brushed a horses hair for 3 straight years until it crumpled into death The truth is there is no such thing as spells The world is always as it is and always as it seems And love is just our own kind voice that we whisper into our own blood
I watch a squirrel get run over by a car on my walk to work She is lying dead in the street and still has an acorn in her little hands I am amazed at how she is able to hold on to her acorn after being tumbled like that after bouncing so high off the street I walk over to the squirrel and see that her face is blown to bits and looks like uncased sausage spilling onto the asphalt But that acorn is still so tight in her hands I pick her up by her tail take off my dress shirt and swaddle her in it then put her in my bag I know right where she is as I walk into work everybody looking at me everybody asking me about my shirtlessness The world is as steady as if it were sewn into the skin of the universe
You tell me a joke about two robbers who hide from the police One robber hides as a sack of cats and the other robber hides as a sack of potatoes That is the punch line somehow the sack of potatoes but all I can think about is how my dad used to throw me over his shoulder when I was very small and call me his sack of potatoes Ive got a sack of potatoes he would yell spinning around in a circle the arm not holding me reaching out for a sale Does anyone want to buy my sack of potatoes No one ever wanted to buy me We were always the only two people in the room

Cadenced their destinies

             These were the men of many breeds
             Who mixed their bloods and sowed their seeds
             Designed in gold and shaped of dross
             They raised the Sword beside the Cross
             These were the men who laughed at odds
             And scoffed at dooms and diced with gods
             Who freed their souls from inner bars
             And mused with forests and sang with stars
             These were the men of prose and rhyme
             Who telescoped empires of time
             Who knew the feel of spinal verve
             And walked the straight line of the curve
             These were the men of iron lips
             Who challenged Dawns apocalypse
             Who married Earth and Sea and Sky
             And died to live and lived to die
             These were the men who dared to be
             The sires of things they could not see
             Whose martyred and  rejected bones
             Became the States foundationstones

As he scouts in the Judas night of a forest aisle
     In big Paul Bunyan as he guillotines
The timber avalanche that writhes a mile
        I see America in Jesse James
As his legends match his horses epic stride
     In big John Henry as his hammer beats
The monster shovel that quakes the mountainside
        I see America in Casey Jones
As he mounts No 4 with the seal of death in his hand
        In Johnny Appleseed as his miracles
Fruit the hills and valleys and plains of our Promised Land
        I see America in Joe DiMaggio
As his bat cuts a vacuum in the paralyzed air
     In brown Joe Louis surfed in white acclaim
As he fights his countrys cause in Madison Square
        I see America in Thomas Paine
As he pinnacles the freedoms that tyrants ban
    In young Abe Lincoln tanned by prairie suns
As he splits his rails and thinks the Rights of Man

Michelson measuring the odysseys of invisible worlds
Brandeis opening the eyes of the blind to the Constitution

Brumidi verving the Capitol frescoes of Washington at Yorktown
Caruso scaling the Alpine ranges of drama with the staff of song
Toscanini enchanting earthward the music of the spheres

             America can sing a lullaby
             When slippered dusk steals down the terraced sky
             Then in a voice to wake the Plymouth dead
             Embattled hordes of tyranny defy
             America can join the riotous throng
             And sell her virtues for a harlot song
             Then give the clothes that hide her nakedness
             To help her sister nations carry on
             America can worship gods of brass
             And bow before the strut of Breed and Class
             Then gather to her bosom refugees
             Who champion the causes of the Mass
             America can loose a world of laughter
             To shake the States from cornerstone to rafter
             Then gird her mighty loins with corded strength
             In the volcanic nightmare of disaster
             America can knot her arms and brow
             And guide across frontiers the untamed plow
             Then beat the plowshares into vengeful swords
             To keep a rendezvous with Justice now

                                                Uncle Sam
Pillows his head on the Statue of Liberty
Tranquilizes himself on the soft couch of the Corn Belt
Laves his feet in the Golden Gate
And sinks into the nepenthe of slumber
And the termites of antiSemitism busy themselves
And the Ku Klux Klan marches with rope and faggot
And the moneychangers plunder the Temple of
        Democracy
And the copperheads start boring from within
And the robber barons pillage the countryside
And the con men try to jimmy the Constitution
And the men of good will are hounded over the Land
And the People groan in the tribulum of tryanny
                                        Then
       Comes the roar of cannon at Fort Sumter
       Or the explosion of Teapot Dome
       Or the Wall Street Crash of 29
       Or the thunderclap of bombs at Pearl Harbor

     I have a rendezvous with America
     At Plymouth Rock
     Where the Mayflower lies
     Battered beam on beam
     By titanchested waves that heave and shock
And cold December winds
That in the riggings pound their fists and scream
   Here   Now
The Pilgrim Fathers draw
The New Worlds testament of faith and law
A government of and by and for the People
A pact of peers who share and bear and plan
A government which leaves men free and equal
And yet knits men together as one man
I have a rendezvous with America
At Valley Forge
These are the times that try mens souls
And fetter cowards to their under goals
Through yonder gorge
Hunger and Cold Disease and Fear
Advance with treasonous blows
The bayonets of the wind stab through
Our winter soldiers clothes
And bloody footsteps stain the deep December snows
     Here     Now
Our winter soldiers keep the faith
And keep their powder dry    
To do or die
I have a rendezvous with America
This Seventh of December
The maiden freshness of Pearl Harbors dawn
The peace of seas that thieve the breath
I shall remember
    Then
Out of yonder Sunrise Land of Death
The fascist spawn
Strikes like the talons of the mad harpoon
Strikes like the moccasin in the black lagoon
Strikes like the fury of the raw typhoon
                              The traitors ruse
                              And the traitors lie
                              Pearl Harbors ruins
                              Of sea and sky
                              Shall live with me
                              Till the day I die
   Here   Now
At Pearl Harbor I remember
I have a rendezvous at Plymouth Rock and Valley Forge
This Seventh of December
                                               IX
                     In these midnight dawns
   Of the Gethsemanes and the Golgothas of Peoples
   I put my ear to the common ground of America
                     From the brows of mountains
                     And the breasts of rivers
                     And the flanks of prairies
                     And the wombs of valleys
       Swells the Victory March of the Republic
       In the masculine allegro of factories
       And the blues rhapsody of express trains
       In the bass crescendo of power dams
       And the nocturne adagio of river boats
       In the sound and fury of threshing machines
       And the clarineting needles of textile mills
       In the fortissimo hammers of shipyards
       And the diatonic picks of coal mines
       In the oboe rhythms of cotton gins
       And the sharped notes of salmon traps
       In the belting harmonics of lumber camps
       And the drumming derricks of oil fields
                                               X
                        In these midnight dawns
Of the vulture Philistines of the unquiet skies
And the rattlesnake Attilas of the uptorn seas 
                        In these midnight dawns
Of the Gethsemanes and the Golgothas of Peoples
                                America stands
     Granitefooted as the Rocky Mountains
     Beaten by the whirlpool belts of wet winds
     Deepchested as the Appalachians
     Sunning valleys in the palms of their hands
     Toughtendoned as the Cumberlands
     Shouldering the truck caravans of US 40
     Cleanflanked as the lavender walls of Palo Duro
     Washed by the living airs of canyon rivers
     Eaglehearted as the Pacific redwoods
Uprearing their heads in the dawns and dusks of ages
Bartender make it straight and make it two
One for the you in me and the me in you
Now let us put our heads together one
Is half enough for malice sense or fun
I know Bartender yes I know when the Law
Should wag its tail or rip with fang and claw
When Pilate washed his hands that neat event
Set for us judges a Caesarean precedent
What I shall tell you now as man is man
Youll find in neither Bible nor Koran
It happened after my return from France
At the bar in Tonys Lady of Romance
We boys drank pros and cons sang Dixie and then
The bar a Sahara we pledged to meet again
But lo on the bar there stood in naked scorn
The Goddess Justice like September Morn
Who blindfolds Justice on the courthouse roof
While the lawyers weave the sleightofhand of proof
I listened Bartender with my heart and head
As the Goddess Justice unbandaged her eyes and said
To make the world safe for Democracy
You lost a leg in Flanders fieldsoui oui
To gain the judges seat you twined the noose
That swung the Negro higher than a goose
Bartender who has dotted every i
Crossed every t Put legs on every y
Therefore I challenged her Lay on Macduff
And damned be him who first cries Hold enough
The boys guffawed and Justice began to laugh
Like a maniac on a broken phonograph
Bartender make it straight and make it three
One for the Negro    one for you and me
At the Courthouse Square
On the Fourth of July
Beneath Old Glorys
Pyrotechnic sky
The town fathers met
Minus Bible and rye
Against the statue
Of Confederate dead
The Mayor spat
His snuff and said
We need a slogan
And he palmed his head
The Sheriffs idioms
Dynamited assent
The Judge croaked a phrase
Latinistically bent
And the Mayor pondered
With official intent
On a neon billboard
As high as a steeple
The travelers puzzle
The amazing sequelThe Blackest LandAnd The Whitest People
Aunt Martha bustles
From room to room
Between attic and basement
With duster and broom
Like an oven grenade
In cobwebby corners
Her broom explodes
A babel of wonders
Her summer crusade
Havocs the bugs
Like an enfilade
She rakes the rugs
The sound and fury
Of table and bed
Whirs a panic of sparrows
To the oaks overhead
Untenable grows
The vast of the house
For even the ghost
Of Lazarus mouse
The fogies convert
Back fences to staffs
And sow their gossip
With Pharisee laughs
Aunt Marthas scowl
Is a lithographs
As the fogies watch
Her attic lairs
Jettison the junk
Of heirloom wares
She shouts Old houses
Need cleaning upstairs
I was a minuteman at Concord Bridge
I was a frigategunner on Lake Erie
I was a mortarman at Stony Ridge
I fought at San Juan Hill and Château Thierry
I braved Corregidor and the Arctic Sea
The index finger brings democracy
These States bred freedom in and in my bone
Old as the new testament of Plymouth Bay
When the Founding Fathers laid the Cornerstone
And rued the thirteen clocks that would not say
The hour on the hour I nerved myself with them
Under the noose in the hand of the tyrants whim
Ive seen the alien ships of destiny
Plow the sea mountains between the hemispheres
Ive seen the Gulf Stream of our history
Littered with derelicts of corsair careers
Ive heard the watchman cry The bars The bars
When midnight held the funeral of stars
I saw horizontal States grow vertical
From Plymouth Harbor to the Golden Gate
Till wedged against skyscapes empyreal
Their glories elbowed the decrees of fate
These States bred freedom in and in my bone
I hymn their virtues and their sins atone
The tares and wheat grow in the selfsame field
The rose and thorn companion on the bush
The gold and gravel cuddle in the yield
The oil and grit and dirt together gush
The Gordian knot to be or not to be
Snares not the free
My faith props the tomorrows for I know
The roots of liberty toughfibered feed
On the blood of tyrants and martyrs the judas blow
Tortures the branches till they twist and bleed
And yet no Caesar vitamined on loot
Can liberty uproot
I am the Unknown Soldier I open doors
To the Rights of Man letters incarnadine
These shrines of freedom are mine as well as yours
These ashes of freemen yours as well as mine
My troubled ghost shall haunt These States nor cease
Till the global war becomes a global peace
